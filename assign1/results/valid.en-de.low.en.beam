you know , one of the major eye in travel , and one of the things that is to travel with research with people with people who still remember the old days , and i feel like
just the thing that 's still used to go beyond the way or the meaning of the world 's sequence of what 's going on with you , or that in the context , the way the will track the breath is the breath of the eye , the
and of course , we will all share the same game .
we 're all going to have all of us born . we bring kids to the world .
that 's where we do .
we need to tell ourselves by the presence through the death , and so it should not be surprising to us that we all singing , dancing , dance and art .
but what 's interesting is that is the unique side of that consumers , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and it does n't matter if it 's about the eye in the forest of atoms , or the food in haiti , or the hotel in the front of the time that i 've been reading with a month , or a trick in the desert ,
and all of those people are teaching us that there are other things , other ways , different ways to what has on the earth .
and that 's one idea that if you think about the hope of hope .
the tumor species of the world was a network of the eye and virtual life that are the world and the earth 's as important as the biological eye that you know in as the biological ones you know as a biosphere is .
you can think of that visual game as you might imagine , you can say , you can say , the mountains of all , the population of all the thoughts and dreams , as dreams and dreams , and the plants that has been designed by human imagination
the eye is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's a very symbol of what we are and what we 're doing was capable of species .
and just as the biosphere got became very much strong , it happened with the eye -- just with any larger speed .
no monkey would say to say to an example , that 50 percent , or more of all sorts of species is just going to be right , because it does n't exist right , and yet this --
and the big deal thing is based on the languages .
so when each of you were born in this room ,
now , this is a language that is not only the equivalent of the infection or a series of the eye .
a language was expression of the human mind .
it 's a means that the soul of the soul is going to be access to a particular culture .
every language of the mind is a game of the mind , a thought of it , an kind of thought .
and from these meters are going to be today while we 're sitting in monterey here , and half of them do n't really get more into the ears in the ears .
you 're not going to be taught , that is , if nothing 's going to make nothing , are you actually already already already already already already already already already already already have dead .
what could be more effective than to be in the office `` the past '' that would be to be a way to talk to your language , are not working with the hope of the ancestors ?
and yet , you know , you know , there 's horrible destiny in fact , anywhere , somewhere in earth , about every two weeks ago , because of every two weeks , you know , every two weeks ,
and i know some of you say , `` this is n't better than ? '' about the world not a better place when we all only going to speak to you ? '' and i said , `` well , this language
let 's be your mouths . ''
and then suddenly they can see how to talk about it , if you could n't talk your own language .
so i want to talk to you on a journey of the eye today , a short journey through the eye to try to try to tell you what it was lost .
now , there 's some of us that kind of forget that i 'm saying , when i say , `` different ways , '' really different possibilities of the mine .
take this child in terms of the southern amazon , the people of it , believe that they 're running the presence from the east from the east , in their head of the east .
this is a people which does n't mean between the color of you and green , because that 's going on the forest by the people who are on .
they have a more intelligent language , and there 's a trick called hospitals , and you have to marry someone who talks to one other language .
all of this is in the 1980s past : the secret to these big houses , which because of six or seven or seven languages , is , you 're not going to hear somebody who is going to learn to a language .
they 're listening to speak and start to speak .
or , you know , one of the most famous tribes i 've ever lived with the eye in the house , a amazing population , the first one in the year of gdp .
in the year of 2006 , five brothers contact , and they made a great mistake .
they were looking at the air photos from the air , and what we 'd like to do was that we have a given note , and those people have come out of the rainforest , in their life , are seen some online to see anything .
they did those photos from the forest floor , tried behind the face or to see the shape , and found out there was nothing and take this thing that are in , and you can get the five brothers with it .
but the interaction are n't just outside of the outside of the way out with the outside .
they 're doing each other .
now , the typical of the deaths happened to go through with you .
we started back to the presence of eight generations , and we found two cases of our natural age , and in fact ,
but at the same time , they had a clue in the forest , which was astonishing .
their head could be able to smell a animal from 40 feet of 40 , and also to determine what the species of this would be .
the early at the early valley for me , i got a really amazing task when my professor was in harvard , whether i was interested in studying , and the secret societies , which was the foundation of the strength of the food and to it ,
to give sense to a sense of , i had a bit more and of course about some of these remarkable wisdom to knowledge and dolphins is not going to be a window of the black economy .
in the opposite , it 's an complex species act .
it 's an interesting thing .
if i was asking you , the big network of being what would you say ?
zk , islam , leo , is the end or whatever .
a continent is always left open because that in africa was no religious faith , and of course , there is an idea of the very common religious thought of religious religious times , which is the world
but what 's so interesting as well is this space between the living and the dead dead .
the living gave the script .
the indus script , you 're going to become , of course under the great water , will be in public water , are the answers on the road of a dance to map the soul of the living room , so that the game will be
so , this is like the game like , `` you see , you go to church and you like .
we just dance in the classroom and become god 's god . ''
and because you 're obsessed , you are going to put away from the spirit . how can you get smarter ?
you see this amazing actor : you have a 3d actor , and you can see there in the blue coal , there is a amazing visualization of the capacity of the notion that the body of the mind is to influence that this is when it comes into
now , from all the people i met , they were the
so , moving the old data civilization that are on the order from working active , and as a consequence that moved out to the people in the eye in the eye , which took a huge sheet of a result .
so in a eye continent , these people were the only people who was never been built by the eye .
now , until this day , they 're going to look from a bowl of wood , and the training education has very extraordinary .
the boys are in the age of three and four years from their families and in a kind of black , in order to go on up to the age of the glacier for 18 years -- and two times from every nine years ,
and during that all of time , you get into the values of your society , values which keep your answers to the challenge that your weapon and only your clients , the most common thing -- or we could say to say the green -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing neighborhood , they 're a lot of day from the end of this amazing life , in their life at the age of 18 ,
it 's wonderful . you must protect it . ''
they call the older brothers and tell me we are the younger brothers for the risk of the world .
now , the level of this is also going to very important .
increasingly , if we think about something like that , we may think either , and we put them up with the same way , and the old author
so , there are n't a set that you 're even going to do , even from your weather protection .
it does n't have a much place in the eye or the cold effect of brazil , but they have yet , through time and the world ,
now , what does that mean ?
it means a little child from the field that believe , in fact , is that the mountain is , the mountain is an eye that is his or her own destiny , it 's a very different person , a little bit of being
whether he 's a member of a mind or a bunch of laughter is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is , the metaphor is which the relationship between the individual and nature changes .
and i grew up into the walls of the golden rule and believed that these forests are there to be able to be able to be there .
that made me to another people like my friends with my friends ,
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different features , you can understand a couple of their remarkable discoveries . like that plant .
it 's a photograph that i took in the middle of the center of the center of the amazon .
this is the board number of most of you heard , the very powerful basic truths from the range of the ocean .
what is so exciting to make is not just a mathematical potential of that in mind , but it is actually made the presence out of two different sources , so , you know , there is a series of view of it ,
these whales have some very strong software that are the illusion , and they are very similar .
if you 've seen the game , how you guys have identify that stuff , these pieces , which you have from various ways to make yourself is also doing .
so to actually identify this eye , it 's kind of like from a while , is to take it out of dense weapons , and the highway at a sea of electricity .
it 's not going to be in reality reality , it 's not the resolution of reality reality .
i even have with my professor richard richard richard , richard t , the man who was reading the discovery of the magic layer in mexico , about this . i said , you know , you do n't feel this kind of thing on the moment where you
but the thing that is with the eye is that they ca n't be able to be missed , because they have become a while in the human life , of course , they 're going to be able to be right .
they can only put in power with some other chemicals , which are effective to the people .
so what is fascinating is that the presence that are growing in the front people are going to be the same thing of the way that we need to make , and ask questions itself .
how could these people get from a spectrum of young species , they do n't find the same business of these two signals that , when they do , when they make a sense of , they do a way of having to create some of the
we 're using this great chinese chinese , and try and mistakes what is going to get out to be as financial .
but when you ask the indians , she 's asking , `` the plant is talking to us . ''
so what does that mean ?
this is the tribe that has 17 property on the board that you all seen in a very large distance , you know , in the forest that seems to us as a way .
and then you ask them , like you put your own fat of them , and you say , i thought something of plants .
i mean you ca n't know there ? '' and i say , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that you take each of these famous things that you were flying on with a wide group , and you sing into an different bag .
now , this is n't going to be giving you a bridge in harvard , but i have a lot more interesting to count .
now , that is the problem of that problem , that even the time that of us who are able to do that is the hard way to train workers , and you 're kind of the past , you 're sort of going on the past ,
so the fact is , you remember yourself to the 20th century , 300 years or technical innovations , it 's not as one period we 're saying about and the vast destruction of the biological and cultural diversity in all the world 's either either
all cultures , again , again , again , in the dance with new skills .
and the problem is not the technology .
the ones did n't want to be less at the heart when they heard to be a meeting and will make the difference of tasks when the americans stopped american than it was a horse , and they make some tasks .
not change and technology and technology have been given to the long point of the eye , it is power , the sound face of resilience .
and you 're going to be on the world where these cultures are n't the end of the world , and these are dynamic people
or if we go to the mountains of nigeria where i used to see a lot more stable , and see the word face of the most of dna .
you know , the genocide that comes across humans from humans , but it 's the game , the destruction of interest in people , is not just civil , but in general , is n't a part of a crime .
and you can do n't understand the suffering when you 've experienced it .
i 've been looking at a boy with a young colleagues in a way where i came out , and then when i came out , i saw the face on the statistics of which you hear the face of the way
and so the young thing that 's young , was as a dog state of the eye in the front of the crime .
this meant that he had killed during the chinese invasion of time .
his uncle turned out with her vagina to the site , which people got to deserts .
his mother was able to be locked up as feeling i was feeling on -- for the crime of the crime .
he was in the age of two years of prison to hide under her the show , because she could n't live with it .
the sister who did n't create these signals , became in a eye .
and one day she goes out of her point on a hospital and it had to be able to do it for seven years to do it to seven years .
the suffering of suffering can be down , but the presence of humans is something that is a difference .
and at the end , we 're really a choice in the end , and if we 're in a show of high world , or in a different world of the diversity of life ?
now , margaret game said before she died about it was their biggest fear , that while we 're going to move in the direction of a toy act , we do n't just see all the whole levels of human risk thinking about , but
and it 's based on to think that our species may have already been there for 100 years .
the game revolution that brought us to the agriculture , and we 're in this moment ,
the modern industrial world we know about it 's an meter old .
now , that little story of my mind , i did n't tell me that we will all answers to the challenges that we are going to be in the next way .
if we 're able to tell this case , if we ask this tumor , we ask the meaning of compassion , will you call it with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we 're going to take the possibility to what we are : people with a lot of awareness that are aware that all people have seen the importance to be a space to move , and there 's great moments of optimism .
here 's a picture i took at the northern end when i went to the eye , when i left with the eye , and this man said it was a wonderful story of his accident .
the holy government is not a good deal to the entropy , and during the presence of years , in the universe of our tracks , they were forced to go out to go out of the way .
the grandfather sent this old prize .
the family who had scared to be your life , took him to all the guns and all these tools .
now , you have to know that there are no fear from the cold , and they used it to their advantage .
the ones were actually made from fish that was thrown in a while .
and the grandfather of man did n't lie from the arctic night , or the eye .
he starts out at the outside , and he took his pants down from his hand and when the crowd started , he began to put it into the shape of a animal program .
he 's saying he was running on the side of the eye , and when it was completely , it was completely , he had a dog 's deal with it .
he gives an dog , and he took a demonstration , the founder of the back , and clean a kid , and took a kid , a other dog and the u.s. rate with the eye at the stream .
you can do anything something .
and this is on the whole symbol a symbol of the resistance of coast flu and all across the world in the world .
the holy government gave up the area in chicago , complete control in china , in the middle area , and the bigger control is bigger than california and south .
it 's our new country and it 's called that we 're called .
it 's just independent area . and they 're all the way .
an amazing example , like a nation , a country that died of people are looking to his search and it can achieve .
and ultimately , i think it 's quite obvious ; at the least of us of us to come back to these conflict goals , realize that they are at all .
you 're the responsibility from someone .
they represent parts of human imagination that are on the past times , and everybody else , are the dreams of our kids , like the dreams of our children 's dreams , it 's part of the distribution of hope .
now , what we 're doing at national environments is that politicians have never done something .
and we believe that there is n't amazing , but we 're thinking that learning the world to change , and so we 're probably probably the best building for physical health 's energy . our website get 35 million copies of every month .
complete countries all the script are sending our blind language .
our career read us by millions .
and we bring a number of travel , and we can put our audience to places that our audience to live from such cultural wonder : and hopefully that the world
thank you .
what i 'm first to do , as quickly as possible is to show the basic work , a new technology that 's going to tell us that microsoft microsoft is at about one year ago . and it 's a environment where they can
we see a lot of them , a lot of movie of digital cameras here that we have an analogy and it , which is kind of trying to make some of them out of it .
and it does not matter how many information we look at how large these types are , or how big the images are .
most of you are a camera one camera , but this one , for example , is for instance , a very scan of the skin and it 's in a area of 300 eye .
it does n't make any difference because the only thing about a system of the system as this is the number of oil in every moment , and it has a very high architecture .
this is an entire book , an example of noise .
this is the answer from engineering 's house . each kind of scale is a chapter .
to prove that it 's really about a text and not a painting , we can do something like that , to show that this is a real representation of the game and not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a while .
i would not recommend .
this is a trick case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image , the beginning of a rock image .
and this really is a really fun , and the wonderful experience is a real set of software with a magazine or of one newspaper what is kind of a media medium with a public act of magnitude .
we also have something about the corner of this particular particular particular particular , very special of the test .
we designed a false situation with a very high survey of which much higher than a normal one to be normal , and we added it in some content of content .
if you want to see this cars , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical dancing , or get down .
and this is really what these ideas are going to happen , these things , to the areas that we put into the site on the screen .
we hope that no longer a family and others ca n't mean , that should not need to be a necessary thing .
of course , the thing is , of course , is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really do n't want much time to say that we 're going to be different in this area .
but this is all the streets in the united states .
so , at the top of nasa , nasa is on nasa .
let 's now a different thing .
so this is actually live in the internet -- you can look at it on the web .
so this is a project with the name that actually would bring two different technologies together .
one is the right , and its others is a very good research on the university , which is a city in the university of the university , under the university of the name of steve
and rick voices was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is where live in the internet . it 's going to be in the eye .
you can see this when we create the way of thinking about these kinds of goals where you can train them through images , and the experiences of work to work is right now .
but the commitment unit of the images is actually here , in fact .
the ones have taken to these pictures together , with the real space , where these pictures that everybody in the forest industry was made for the woods industry , and you can see the elements of
i do n't know exactly how to show them in time .
there are what you are much more sophisticated .
i 'd like to show up one of the original things that i 'd like to show up from speech , and this is about a early prototype from a early prototype of fact that we 've been working at the summer in summer to show you , what
we had to go out because of lawyers . we needed .
this is a ring of the presence of cotton paper , who 's essentially on the computer with images of flickr . give you just a single piece of men in tanzania and you 're going to get images of men in sweden and the eye . there
so this is all the things that we have about and they 're all in this way in this way that we 're doing , to each other .
and we can move in these very easy way .
you know , i 've never felt that i 'm going to work at microsoft .
i 'm very grateful for the scale here .
i suspect you can see there are a lot of different kinds of cameras : all of it is about a pretty large number of professional , a fairly large number of you all of them , that all have been taken in that environment .
and if you can , i will get some of the strange protection .
many of you are thrown in charge faces , and you 're so much of them .
there 's a series of dna sitting there -- here you are .
this is actually a little bit of popular satellites , which was recorded really named , right ?
and we can actually move from a physical view of that environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environments , and it will all look from the entire collective memory of that , like , create to each other .
and all these photographs are connected to each other , and there 's something which is going to be bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model of model that comes from all over the earth .
looking at this as the health of narrative view of creativity 's disease 's work .
and this is something that complexity , with the people , and it 's growing with the user for the users .
their own photos are going to be on the order that has killed another person .
if somebody made out the hard and get all the japanese and decided that they all have all of them , then a picture of all the data with all this data , and i can get them as a start to look to this room , to use
and of course , the oil that are the very rich rich of virtual virtual models from any interesting part of the earth that does n't just just have just come through with you , or from innovation and so on , it would continue to be
thank you .
do you understand her ? the software will be able to make that in a certain point , all the images , all pictures , that are , in the world 's common , are used by someone in the world ?
yes . she does n't discover anything .
if they want to go through the images between the pictures between the images .
and you do this because this is because of content into the images .
and this is really exciting if you think about the most higher information of the artistic world , which have many of these pictures .
so , like , if you go to pictures for your sentences , you might ask your sentences and the text of your website , a lot of information about it , which image is .
so , what if the image they spread with all their pictures ?
then the scale of the cybercriminals is going to go together and the amount that makes you feel really high . it 's an enemy .
so , this is really incredible . thank you left .
thank you very much indeed .
i 'm going to share with some things from my book , as i hope i 'm going to do other things that you 've already heard of , and i 'm going to try to make a few connections if you
i 'm going to start what 's going to be what i call `` the oldest portrait '' ''
the strange thing about what is there ?
and the strange spot from all western societies .
and the strange thing that we have is , if our goal is the goal , the one of our own citizens is , we 're actually going through the eye of the capital .
the reason is that freedom to yourself is good , valuable , make good value for the human one .
when people have freedom , each of us are about ourselves to do the things that make our humanity , and no one has to choose for us .
the way to translate freedom is choice .
the more people have people , the more freedom the more of freedom , they have more freedom , the more of freedom , the more of the tools they have .
this is , i think , so that 's so deep in our collective community that it does n't come to mind .
and it 's also a deep deep in our life .
i 'm going to give you some examples of what to do modern progress .
this is my favorites . there 's no big one .
i just want to just say anything about that .
there 's more likely like you do in my store , if you do n't do the use of the ten extra extra extra ones that you 're buying about is to make a huge number of
and so that 's how it 's the supermarket .
and then they go to the local store to go out to be a magician -- clay , voice , voice , up radio , up . and in this one electronics of business there there are so many of these things to do .
we can put millions of different different software with the components that will be used in this one business .
they have to admit that this is a great option .
in other ways , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you had to have a telephone , you wanted to have a phone that was wanted to be , as long as i was doing , it came to live bell .
you 're able to do your phone out . you do n't go into it .
a consequence of the evidence was that the phone is n't broken .
these days are gone .
now , we now have almost an infinite set of text in mobile phones , particularly in the world of cell phones .
these are mobile phones 's future .
my favorite is in the middle --
and if you 've seen that until now not in your business , you can be sure that they 're going to be soon .
and what it 's doing is to walk in the business and put it question .
do you see the answer to the question is ?
the answer is no . ''
it 's not possible to buy a cell phone that does n't go too much .
in other aspects of life , which is an important object as we 're buying in the same direction of choice , the same increase of choice .
health -- it is not the case in the united states in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor 's saying to the doctor , we could do a thing .
a one has got to risk and risks .
b has become those benefits and risks . what is you going to do ?
and she said , `` doctor , what should i do ? ''
the doctor says a set has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , `` when you were , joe , what would they do ?
the doctor says , `` but i did n't . ''
the results is , we call it it to be `` patient . '' and this sounds like a good thing , but in the reality , the burden of the matter of responsibility for me is white ,
there 's an tremendous marketing for private drugs for people like them and me , that 's what if you think about it , you do n't make sense , because we do n't buy them .
why do you get to get around us if we can not buy ?
and the answer is , you do that from the next morning , we put it on the next morning , to ask to the change of the office morning .
something that works so cool about how our identity is now a question of choice to show this slide .
we ca n't make identity ; we invent it .
and we invent so much as we want to do .
so that means every day every day when you leave them on your morning , you have to decide what kind of of person want to be .
and in terms of marriage and family , there were a time that is the trick that almost every one had been in one , and that they could go as soon as fast as they could , and then quickly kids were
the only ones that have said , `` who '' not when , and not what they were doing .
and today , all right now is easy .
so i 'm also also also wonderful intelligent students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work than i 'd been doing .
and it 's n't because they 're less smart , and not because they 're less carefully .
it 's because they are , you know , you 're wondering , `` should i marry that ? i should i marry it now ?
should i be able to be marry ? i 'll be to have kids , or did we do a career ? ''
these are all questions .
and you will answer these questions , whether that means all of these problems , i do n't know what 's going to do , and not good grade to the front of my history .
and in fact , they should do that . those are critical questions .
work — we 're as well as being what happened with technology , with technology , to make every minute from every day , to work from every place to every place on every place that would work from every place , in the game , the game .
and by the way , it 's a corner i 'm going to tell you about what that works at that .
i 'll not tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , so what it means , that incredible freedom of the choice we have to do in terms of work and again if we should work or work or work .
we can play all of our children play by the best time , and we have our phone phone , and our brand in other school , and our laptop are probably on our pockets .
and even when all of them are all together , every minute where we 're asking our child to see , as we 're in the age of our child ,
should i be this email ? should i write that letter ? ''
and even when the answer is `` no , '' there 's certainly your experience of the people who are very differently , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look at , great things , and little things that we have , material things and purpose is a question that 's choice .
and the world in which we lived , it was like this .
i want to say , there was some choices , but not all that is a question of election .
and so the world in which we 're going to look like this now .
and so the question is , are good news or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what 's good about is , so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to be bad about this .
so , all of these , you have two effects , two negative effects in people .
it 's an effect of that way , is that it is silk instead .
so with so many many options , you can choose if people get very hard to choose to decide .
i 'm going to give you one of you , you know , i 'm giving you a study of investment in a wider study in a study of manhattan .
a woman who had had access to me , access to the eye of the most of about a million employees , about 2000 different jobs .
and what it was n't found was that one 10 people had taken the tsunami , which was a year for the two percent .
they provide 50 to the past -- 10 percent less employees on it as if they 're only going to provide five .
because it 's between the lack of time which are available , it 's so hard to decide which you want to choose to do tomorrow .
and then they go up , and then they never come and tomorrow .
now , this is not just a mean , people have to say , when they go into it , do n't you have enough money ,
by the way that it 's not today , you are in 10 , a year a year at the field of the brain , the happy that you have been happy .
in fact , it 's a consequence from a lot of choices .
and i think it makes the world looks like this .
you really want to make a decision , if it 's all right , right ?
they do n't want to choose the wrong force behind it or though , the wrong spot .
so this is an effect . the other thing is that even if we overcome the world and come to the decision , we end up less to have the outcome of the outcome as if we have a chance to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is founded by the big choice of people , when they buy one , and it is not perfect — and what is perfect ? it 's easy to imagine that you 'd
the more opportunities there are , the easier is , it 's not a choice for the choice you make .
second thing , `` economists , '' what economists call .
dan , he has done a big point , tomorrow by telling us how very much the way that we realized about things that we compare it .
well , if there are a lot of alternative to think , it 's easy to imagine the characteristics of alternative that you can imagine about , you know that makes them less to the depression that you win .
here 's an example . for you , that are no new york , sorry i 'm sorry .
but here 's what you should think of .
here 's a couple of the skin to the skin .
very expensive real stuff .
beautiful beach . you 've got it all about yourself .
what might be better ? `` it says man 's man , `` it 's mark .
everybody in my online neighborhood go .
i could shoot my house in front of my house . ''
and he was spending two weeks when he thought he 'd described the possibility day day a great lot from a great lot of .
so there 's happiness that we get through our own beings , even if that what we wanted to have fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to have many times , the more attractive features of these things are going to go into it .
here 's another example of this .
well , this cartoon is some people in this cartoon .
he makes it to live , and maybe to do things and to do this .
but the more one of the point that he is that you are , you always choose to decide , you know , if you want to decide to decide , you decide to do other things you do .
and those other things about many of the institutional properties are going to , and it 's going to do less , are going to do less .
third , be the expectations , is the expectations .
this has made me met when i wanted to teach my home .
i 'm growing up , almost all the time .
and there was a while where it was just an kind of form , and they bought them , and they 're bad , they were incredibly lucky and if they put it long enough enough , they 're not going on `` ok . '' okay .
so , up to buy new school , to many years of the game of the time of the day of the old game and said , `` i would have been to have some more angry , here is my size . ''
and the third said , `` you want to , `` do you want to pick out , easily you , are n't you easy to say , `` you want to say , `` do you want to be a big ?
do you want to write a living or anything ?
do they want to be able to do with holes ?
if you want to pick down far , blah , blah -- blah , blah ... and so on , he said him .
my business character has been down , and after i 'm afraid i said , `` i love the way that was the only kind of thing . ''
he had no idea what was , so i spent one hour with all of these things -- and we 're going to go into the business -- and i say that truth , and i say the truth -- to the risks i 've ever had .
i had better , and all these kinds of things i 've better to have .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote , i wrote a whole book to try and explain myself .
the reason i was doing most bad , all of these things , with all these opportunities , my expectations of what it is to a good couple of tomorrow .
i had a very low expectations , and i had n't had a physical expectations when it was what you were in a kind of form .
when they got in 100 ways they would have had one thing to be perfect .
and what i got was fine , and it was n't a perfect .
and so what i was getting out of is what i needed to , and what i had was , i was forced to me at what i needed to do .
people in people in the live of people allowed to give the expectations of what people are going to be as good as well as good choices are going to be as well .
and that leads to a lot of time with the results , even when the results are good .
nobody in the world of the marketing knows this . because if they were going to , do n't all this stuff here .
the truth are more like this .
the reason that it 's all about worse was better than anything that was bad than all of the people , it was possible for people to make sure that they were to do that in people who were a safe surprise .
today , in the world of that we live -- we have wealthy citizens , citizens , we know as an expectation -- the best thing that you can hope is , is so good for them to be good about it .
you 're never going to be surprised , because your expectations , ladies .
the secret to avoid the secret -- that 's what has all you 've got -- the secret to sequence is low expectations .
i want to say -- a little bit of the moment -- i 'm married with a woman , and she 's really wonderful .
i could n't do better . i did n't fall .
but in general language is not a bad thing .
well , there 's a consequence that the effect of the head of a bad head of our head is when it 's just a way to buy , is that if you 're grateful , and they ask why , who 's in , the answer is
if hundreds of different forms are available , you are , you 're going to be buying the lower one , and you ask them why who who 's in charge ?
it 's also clear that the answer is in the question : they 're .
you could better do it .
with 100 different types of head of asia in the spring , there 's no way for a mistake .
and so when people meet decisions , they are now as well as they are well good about , they feel on the house about it , they train themselves .
clinical depression 's in the world last world .
i think that i believe , is the only time -- not the first to do , but a commitment to this led to the depression , and also , is that human experience , because your designs are so far high , and then , if you 've
and so that 's the time we 're going to go better , we 're doing it , we can feel bad , and we feel it .
so let me remember you .
so this is what we 're kind of doing this , we all think of -- completely wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no question that i 'm a lot of things that are worth better than no , but it does n't follow that more choice is better than you have to have .
there is a magic amount . i do n't know what 's going to do .
i am pretty sure that , there 's a period of time we 've described the public function .
now , as an answer , i 'm almost finished -- as a change question , which is about thinking about this , which is what all of these things allow you to take in the late societies of societies , is material .
there are many places in the globe , and we 've heard about many of them whose problem is not too much .
you see , it 's a problem is they have too .
so the things that talk is that i 'm talking today is a fundamental problem of modern , rich societies , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and smell , steve brown tells you about how to help this expensive , and hard to do not help , it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm told is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy to help them .
you actually get hurt .
they worry that we are bad there .
when something of the people in the society of our society can make these societies into these societies in these societies that people would have to do is they would not be better life , but our dignity would be smarter , too .
now economists call this a trick .
now , for that , all of it is better , not just the poor , because all of these big choices are being unknown with us .
finally , they 're reading to this cartoon , and , a powerful person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish know ?
they do n't know anything that could . ''
now , i 'm now going to make a bad view of the world , and that is the way i read that first .
but the more i think about it , the one i got to see the fish knows what knows .
because the truth is that if you 're able to do it , you know , you can get a freedom of yourself , you do n't get freedom . you have of course , you know .
if you do it in terms , so it 's possible , you lose happiness .
it gets up the wall and the great ones .
everybody needs a trick .
and this is almost a lot of perfect security -- perhaps for the fish , it 's definitely that it 's definitely true for us .
but the game is to get a recipe for schizophrenia , and i suspect , and i guess a disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i 've already talked about some of these projects before , about what the human genome , and what could mean , and the discovery of the new groups of gene .
in fact , we start to start with a new point : we 've got the biology 's biology , and we now try to get away from digital code in a new phase of biology and build new life .
we 've always tried to ask some amazing questions .
what 's life ? it is something that i believe that many biologists have trying to get understanding , and that 's what 's on different scales .
we 've been trying to make a lot of programs to make it till the power games .
we almost have about 20 years of disease . when we were able to beat that the game , the change from the social world of biology was in the digital world of this computer .
now we 're going to be asking whether we 're capable of life , or whether we can build new lives , out of this digital universe ?
this is a map of a small organism , the fact that the smallest genome of an species can be able to count in the lab , and we 've tried to do that with a little bit smaller genome .
we managed to give about a hundred and a half genes to be by the united states , so that 's where this is .
but if we look at this , the map , which is very , very simple to us , and trust us , trust me , but if we all see these genes one , it 's really unlikely that this would be lead to a living cell .
and so we decided that it 's the only way in front of this field is actually actually trying to have the individual components and to ask and some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to question with the question we can like a organic picture ?
can it be the chemistry of doing that really large molecules which was never done before ?
and , if we can , we can go to the building ?
a cancer is just a piece of chemical materials .
our steps , our steps , were exponentially exponentially .
our ability to writing genetic code is very slow , though , but yet , at the last point , we would put in an exponential curve now .
we started now 15 years ago .
actually , there 's some years of processes with a crime before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world , the small pieces of dna , for 30 or 50 letters , and so it 's a free process , and the longer you happen , and so you can do a piece , more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way to develop it with these little pieces of pieces , and we had to follow mistakes .
this was our first attempt that we 've seen with the digital information , in the genome ,
it 's a small virus of bacteria .
we 've made little pieces of pieces , and we made a trick and we got a local molecule of the 5,000 molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we take this piece , chemical , chemical and a bacteria , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and they made these
the common particles then were going to attract the cells of the cells , they came back to cells , and they were getting more and killed apart .
recently , i 've talked to the conclusion , and they told them that this model is just x-ray .
they laugh more than she does this .
so we think that this is a situation in the software , actually , in fact , you can build your hardware in an organic system .
but we wanted to get a lot . we wanted to build a whole game building up . it 's more than the size of letters , and this is how we build it in the size of the virus , we were able to realize the size of
design is a key , and if you 're going to start with digital information has to start to start this digital information in the computer .
when we went out to the genome for the genome to one mistake in a mistake per mistake per mistake of 10,000 .
we found about 30 mistakes for a 30 .
part of design is , can make pieces of creating the 50 letters long long , and look at with other people to build smaller to build it .
we built a unique elements of it .
they might have heard that we have built in that .
think about it : we 've got a game code : it 's said , c , g and t .
so , this letter -- this letter has about roughly 20 acids -- and this is one of a single amount of things that 's on each of the acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write the genetic code to write in our words , the thought we thought .
we only started out with this .
some people were taught it was n't poetry .
we 've got the pieces of this , that we were able to do it , just , and there is , and there is , we were able to do it , and there is that there is a grain , and there 's
and we started to create pieces , we start looking at the five , five to the five or open letters to make these close , to make these back to the way to make that again .
in any step , we do these pieces of being produced by us , because we tried to create a very profound process , to create it in an minute .
we 've tried to get to the point of the field of the time .
so , that looks like a trick .
if we 're going to look like right in these right , it 's about 100,000 -- that this is not just a simple opportunities to be modern leone . so we went to help other options .
we knew that we 're born by a human mechanism called the biology to fix dna that can fit these pieces .
here 's an example of it . there are a organism called the three million samples in radiation .
you see in the upper business you see his brain just gone apart .
12 to 24 hours later , all over the way again , again , again , again .
we can do with thousands of organisms that can do .
these organisms can be totally dynamic , they can even live in the supermarket .
and i 'm absolutely sure live in space is going to move and move to look at the search of conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there 's lots there out there .
here 's a trick from the molecule that we 've made that process by using , in fact , we used to use a game where we use the real design of space we have done it , yeast and put it up together .
this is not an normal device .
it 's a big molecule that we ca n't see it .
this is footage about a long time from a time that 's six seconds .
that 's the time we did recently .
so these are the eye code , it 's the most biggest molecule that has been created with the fabric that has ever created by humans .
this has been a running with 300 million .
if we spent it from a while 10 , without those things , we would spend it to go out of it , just about this genetic code .
now how do we start with a organic bomb ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , with a virus , is very simple . it has much more complicated with the bacteria .
it 's also easier when you 're in the presence of what we are , you 're going to go out and there is a different place , and that 's exactly what they 've all heard about density .
so the area is in the cell , however , we 've seen recently we 've shown out that you can try to have a whole map of a nuclear set of a nuclear company for the other of the other .
we 're building the field of one of the time in technology , in terms of those two of these two things of how humans are like people and interact , and we gave them a few of them that we could actually do ,
the new field went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that we end up here , but we tried to bring the process .
that 's the presence of this here .
we 've taken all sorts of species here , or a third of the species , and the third of the eye , each time has to have thousands of them on just a second trick in only a species .
so people who may imagine evolution that has become a gene at that moment at the moment a moment , that 's a lot of biology for the biology .
there is , it 's called that there are called dna to dna .
the field in the cell has been any of them ; there was no ; the power who have put it already .
it was forced in the cell and realized the other brain in the eye , and that was how we had a cell , we had a cell with a new chromosome .
it 's blue because it was because of the genes we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the world 's species , and completely in a new species we gave in the cell .
all the proteins changes the logic , when we 've read the genetic code , it was exactly what happens .
it may be like tea sound , but we ca n't we move to the presence of things , make things very well .
now , i think that this is not the eye force -- this is actually based in religious billion of evolution in evolution .
and i 'm happy time we might make a new form of the project in which we could give massive new minds based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious to what we need .
and we 're at the way from a way from the six billion people who are doing this at the next 40 years .
to ask it to my connection : i was born on a year in the year .
today three people have shown on this planet for every one of the year , in the 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food food , with planning up , and clean water , medicine , on the other one of the two billion people .
it will be a challenge for nine .
we need over about five billion tons of coal , billions of greenhouse oil oil , and that 's a hundred million dinosaurs on the day .
if we think about biological cases or any process to replace this , it will make a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's all of the co2 on this material on the atmosphere .
we 've got , from our discoveries from the world , a database with roughly 20 million cells , and i think that these people are the presence of the future .
the ones have a dozen components , and look at the diversity of all this .
so we 're going on first line with the borders of biological reality and about the idea .
we 've got technologies because of this journey to do that in terms of what we call ourselves fight .
now we 've got the possibility of a large robot going to build the millions of oil that we can make a day .
if you 're going to imagine these 20 million million genes , you can make that process to create or drugs or drugs in the process of it , we can transform it with a little team to change more experiments than the past 20 years of science .
and it 's just the responsibility . it 's what you can do is to turn up there for rich , production of chemicals or with you and so on .
this is a shot from a collective eye on that we work working together , and indeed new species in the computers design design .
you know , we do n't necessarily know what it is like , and we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
now , we focus on the fourth generation in the fourth generation .
they 've recently seen an bad experiment in the way they have a bad experiment .
we have superstar growth and the third generation , and the third generation , it 's very soon of those who have a lot of share , like haiti or different ways about it .
but , as we think , the only way to think of biology is a large impact without the cost of food to a cost of food , or of their availability , if we see co2 as you can see and why we are working on
and we think we 're going to be the first with the third generation , and in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery , the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1968 .
he lives in the floor , it lives something like miles of times a lot of comfort .
it represents co2 in the way of using hydrogen use to be a value of hydrogen .
we 're looking at whether tens of we can use co2 to make that easy to do the same place , you know that co2 is in the fuel , to make this process .
within a short time we have , we may be able to do in one of the very fundamental questions about life .
you know , you 've really -- as we really -- do n't really get into terms of all of the whole century industry , right , right , right . if you could do this at ted , where anything else
but the same thing we 're working on is how to use the same way we need to do from the development of these signals .
you saw it this year with the flu , we 're always going on there 's a year at the front , and then you have a dollar .
i think this is changed by getting in this position .
this is how the future might look at changes with change ,
we 're very early at better . our goal is just that we might have a chance to survive for a chance to do it . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i 'm listening back to get to try to explain how the machine is working .
so now it 's far right now . and for all of those things , the lhc is the most important scientific experiment that was ever ever been in the diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a 500 second second , in the universe of the universe -- and up to 600 million per second .
it 's just the violent lanes .
this is the machine underneath the machine below saturn .
we can take them to click pictures in the eye .
i 'm on this work . it 's called economic detector -- 17 feet in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular image of that song in the global state so you see it .
on 10 years last year , the machine was walking around the first time .
and this picture is taken by sheep .
it took up these cameras in the control control .
it 's a picture of the first eye that took all the way back to the lhc , then with a part of the lhc to make a rain waste from particles on the detector .
when we saw this image , when we first saw this image on the decade , we knew that the machine is working , what is a big colony .
i do n't know if this was a biggest eye in the google age , or when someone walked to the google age , and so found the page .
it means that we did a cultural impact next .
about one week later , there 's a problem with the machine which had to do with this machine -- that the golden functions here .
and these are the nest level that are running by the machine when the machine is going on .
well , the engineers of you are going to look at and say , `` do n't you do that . these are little jobs . ''
you can do that because if you 're far down , you 're going to look at it very well .
so in risk level , it is unique than the space between the stars , can get these jobs out of tension .
in one of the connections , between the connections where i have in , in the lhc , there were a trick .
by doing the mechanical ones , it 's a whole way to suddenly get resistance resistance .
so this was the result .
well , this is all even more as you think that you are about 20 tons of pollution and around about about 30 inches of community .
so we 're looking for about 50 in the government .
and we had to take it out what we did .
let 's get them to take you go .
they 're all again again .
over the end of the 1930s , the lhc will be back again .
we will bring it up , and we can actually get to the first world in june or july , and then we 're trying to figure out how the conditions of the universe is .
well , obviously , on a way of these things , the debate , to the debate about the debate about the debate about science , is easy to this place . it 's easy to fail .
i think the fact that is hard to be the fact that we 're going to be able to look out about the borders , it 's the value of things like the big value .
i 'm going to leave up my latest words to a english scientist , about the future , who , like i guess , when he had the most dangerous design of his eye on the end of the time , the human ideas of the human spirit
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
so i 'm going to do books , but it 's obviously more than that .
it 's my major , i think , like , i 'm going to love a love and the fascination .
and i did not expect that this is going to change .
however , it 's a little bit more comfortable in my life and my career was made to me here to think of me to consider this work completely at the work of this work .
this is an amazing event , that i wrote a book called the face , solomon , who , and that , decided to any of my previous books out of doing the world , and a big eye , international international
and the result is that i do n't matter . i 'm not going to become treated as i 'd be the beginning of the world .
seriously , very serious .
for example , she gets really worried about that and say `` fear no fear , you 're not going to become this success here ? ''
do n't any of them , that your whole life 's life and never create a book , how are in the world , never interested ? ''
okay , that 's really going to power .
but it would be worse if i did n't remember me over 20 years ago when i was a teenager , i told me that i wanted to be an writer , with the same kind of online response .
people said , `` did you have a fear that never seemed to have ?
do n't fear you believe you were the opposite of you in a line that was happening ?
did you have to fear that kind of thing that you get your life for your life and never , and that you 're going to die on a while for your dreams -- your mouth
so you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of this questions is : is there it is .
yeah , i 've got scared of all this stuff .
and that 's all i had .
and i have a lot more things that i fear , that nobody would see .
like algae -- and other voices of things .
but if it 's about writing , i have spent this recently , i 've got to ask me , `` why ?
is this being the display ?
is it sense that he should be expected to be afraid of to to do the work he feels alive ?
and what about the creative novel , in order to convince us for us to make ourselves what 's going to happen -- in the way , in a way of how other jobs do n't do ?
my father , for instance , was great , and i can do no situation in his 40 years when he wanted to ask whether he would have been afraid .
and you 're with your saying , john -- how do you get to that ?
it just did not know what they do ?
but to be fair -- the group of product have not received for the citizens who get the call of the eye .
but we seem to have the writer , but it was not just the author , but it seems to have all the creative world , seem to have this reputation to be affordable .
all you have to do is , you need to look on , in fact , you 're on the fact of really great fact about the 20th century , the young and often , often from the hand of the hand .
and even the ones that do n't actually think about wikipedia seemed from their ability to actually be treated in .
but , in a minute , just before the death in his best interview , is at my books , a little bit of continued to go .
an extraordinary statement , which you can do about your life technology .
but we do n't even know if we hear something like this , because we know this kind of point for such a long time -- we kind of
the question that i want to put with each of here is , is this idea for you and right ?
do you feel about it ? because with only one airplane , i 'm not sure that i feel like .
i think they find them , right ?
and i think it is a dangerous thing , and it 's not what it 's going to take you to get into the next century .
i think it is better when we live our major creative experiences .
and i realized , i believe , in my situation -- really dangerous , to start this dark path of the more dark path in a way -- particularly in the fact that i really am in my career .
that means -- you see , i 'm pretty young , i 'm just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 to me in myself .
and it 's very obvious that everything i am now going to write about right now , from the rest of the work that after the game , which is just success for my last book , right ?
i tell it it up , because we 're all friends now -- so it 's clearly that i 'm going to do my greatest success .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought of thinking that someone can bring in the nine and nine in the morning . i do n't want that .
i 'd better continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seems like , you have to be able to write to be able to design a kind of eye weather .
and somehow i have to do it with a way to write a certain distance to the real reason between me and my very natural lessons on how the response will be to be writing .
as i was looking for models , for models to do this , i also was for my past , and i 've been trying to figure out other societies to see to see whether they might help a better ,
this is looking forward to me , and this old civilization .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but the old union and rome are not believed that creativity comes from humans , okay ?
they thought that creativity was a kind of honor that was based out of a sudden of speed that comes from the people --
the state of the greeks called this universal driver set of creativity .
from what we would see is that he would have a interview who would have started to get away from close to further .
and the lawn 's personal idea called this kind of a creative mind .
this is amazing . the gods did n't really thought that there was a particularly intelligent individual .
they thought that a genius that was a genius that was a genius that was in fact you live in the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls --
this is brilliant -- there 's a distance i talked about -- the psychological board that you were asking you to follow your actions .
and everybody knew it was so working , right ?
the artist artist was in front of the eye in front in front of a certain things , like , for example , there 's too much right , right ?
when your work brilliant , you do n't look at all of you , and anyone knew you had the same way to make you .
if your work is like , not your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew their arm , your genius .
so the people in the west were really long time on creativity .
and then the way and everything changed , we had this big idea , and let 's put this big idea of the human individual of the universe ,
it has the beginning of the marketplace , and people began to start that creativity was completely from our own individual , completely from their own individual .
for the first time the story of the story , people are listening to these guys , or those artists sound a genius -- rather than it has a genius .
i have to tell you , `` i think it was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a human person to allow you to be able to think about it or you be like the lower and the essence and the essence of all beautiful protection , creative , are a little bit of responsibility to get a
it 's like someone to make that sun .
the software system , and they 're making the guy , and i think it creates all of this inner expectations in the success of success .
i believe that this is what our artists are in the last billion years of the last 500 years .
and , if this is true -- and i think this is true -- it 's the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to an primitive understanding about the local people and to the mystery of the creative box .
perhaps not .
maybe we can do it out about 500 years of 500 years not simply just in an face for a talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really been a very strong scientific argument that they would mean about the idea of the idea of -- basically -- that people are wrong and are able to go on their projects so that .
i 'm not going to take all of you on that journey .
but the question that i want to do is that why do n't you ?
so why not think ?
because it does n't really make much sense of how anything else i 've heard about , and when it went to explain , the most crazy crazy to be able to explain the creative process in the process of creative process .
a process that goes on -- like anyone know that they tried to do something -- so in other words : actually , everyone here -- not always quality of them .
in fact , he can actually feel quite a laugh sometimes .
i had a lot of time in recently as much as i went in , i had the extraordinary american museum of stone , the idea now , that was about 90 life , which is her whole life , and it told me that the galaxy
she said it would be like a game of the air .
that was about the country on her country .
she felt when it was making the earth to go into it .
they knew that she could only do that in a moment that she could do , and that was in her words --
she goes as the devil to home while she was taken away from this poem . it was the only thing , it 's really , she had to go enough to a piece of paper , and had to get it to her
she was n't very fast enough at the other , not very fast . it goes , and he goes down , but she did n't care the house and they gave it , she would go beyond the country and --
and then there were that moments , i did never forget , and she said , there was moments that there were moments where she almost did .
so , she goes to the house and looking at the paper , and she 's looking at it , and she runs a pen just when it comes into it and then , she -- she said , she -- she was able to get it like
she was wearing the poem at his own one , and she pulled it back in her body , and i put it to the piece of paper at paper .
and when they did it , the poem was a little bit , and there 's a paper on a paper -- but then the last word in the first word for the first .
when i did heard that , `` what i thought is an incredibly thing -- it 's exactly how my creative process is doing . ''
at all , that 's not such like my creative process -- i 'm not the ones who am n't .
i 'm a trick . to work , i have to stand every day , and i realized
but even i have a thing sometimes of the thing to do with this thing .
and i guess many of you have done this as well .
and even i got working , or ideas that come out of a source with me that i really did n't identify .
what 's the thing ?
and how do we begin to lose ourselves , without doing it without trying to lose the minds , we even even do the opposite of the opposite to be in technical health ?
so for me , that 's the best way of how you can do this ,
and we talked about this theme , and then you know what ? most the time of his life was shown out of modern , modern artist , who was trying to
but then he became older and writing . he told me that he went out to be one day in los angeles -- and there 's how everything was going for him .
he was going to speed up with high speed as a sudden , as a sudden , you could suddenly hear a little extension of a drug , and how it 's a lot to him , it 's hard to get away right , and he wants to
he does n't have a piece of paper , he 's no pen ; he 's got a pen war .
so he begins , well , the old one thing in him about how i 'm going to lose this thing and i 'm going to get into that song on forever .
now , i 'm not enough , i 'm going to do it right .
but instead of panic , he was just heard about it .
he ended up all of this , he ended something completely new .
he just looked like he was in heaven and say , `` okay , ca n't you see that i will go to car . ''
do i go to you like i could n't give a song in a moment ?
if you 're going to exist , there 's one time to come back to you , if i can make myself around you .
if you do n't , somebody else today .
go out and sticks . ''
his whole line has changed .
not the work . it 's often as dark as you 've done ,
but the process , and the hope that it looked around was -- they 're actually beautiful than he would take the wrong thing that he was doing , was n't a little bit of trouble and it 's a little bit of it in a way
it could take a cheap , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , to get some sort of conversation between the conversation of tom and such a conversation , which was not shown in tom , which was n't one thing .
when i hear that history , it changed a bit like this a little bit of the way that i was working , and i 've got saved .
and this idea , i sat when i was sitting in the face of the eye , california , who was the place , and i fell into one of the world 's thing we 're all looking at if we were working on something and
not just bad ; it 's all the worst ever time .
i started thinking , i was just supposed to make this as a project .
but then i immediately talked about how tom was talking in the wild sky , and i tried it .
so i took my looking at my favorite view , and i spoke to the minister , and i spoke to you at an empty corner of the room .
i was talking to say , `` stop , and i 've both you not know if this book is n't enough that it 's not my fault , really ?
because you see , i have anything that i have , really , and i do n't even have more than that .
so when you want to have a better show , you 've got to have your share of the nature of nature .
okay . so , if if you do n't do this , you know what you do with this .
i 'm going to get writing , because i 'll do that with my job .
and i 'd like to give you , `` i want to put this for my part of the jobs here . ''
because ... at the end of that as he says , in centuries , in the end of the people alone , the people will go with russian crime and music , that were five sister -- until the end .
these are always great , and they were all the dancer , they were fantastic , they were fantastic .
and again , it 's very rare , it 's special , it happened to be special , one of the tumors was actually accepted .
and i know you know what i mean . because i know they 're all saw a bridge sign on your life .
and it was as if he had to put through a kind of airplane and the crime , he did nothing different than he has ever done before -- 1,000 feet before . but all i get together .
and all of a sudden , he did no longer get human human rights .
and he went out of the inside , sitting off and down , and it all turned fire from a dry fire .
as far as the back of this happened , people felt what that was : they called it it in the name .
they put the eyes together , and they were singing , `` okay , galvao , galvao , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
so interesting historical workers , they got this practice , and the one thing that has been changed in the course of those days , in the course of those days , to go to you with the end , the way that you still do n't go
when a small and an asteroid designer in spain , in spain , a magic issue is done : is in spain , and the eye , air , is amazing , there is : one of the god in god .
and that 's great because we need that .
but , the most part of this is what the next morning , when the popular itself is sitting , and when the dancer itself is , that it 's 11 o'clock at 11 time -- and he does n't have any longer a trick .
he 's just a commercial measure of energy 's disease -- and maybe he never gets to rise to these three again .
and perhaps any of god wo n't call god 's name if it comes to him . but what do you want to start with his life ?
that 's hard .
that is one of the eye of a creative living .
but perhaps it does not have to be as much as you thought about the beginning of the beginning , the most powerful thing of your work came to you .
if you may only believe that they 're a musician -- from the lower source of their life that 's going to be in someone in someone else when they were done with this .
so if we 're beginning to think about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking of thinking and so , i think , with security months , as i was at the book , i was working at this book , which soon dangerous ,
what i do say to myself is , if i get on it , i 'm not scared .
it is not trivial , right ?
just make your job .
it 's always working for your perception , which is what he said , `` you know . ''
if your job 's a dancing , dance .
if the stupid is genius , wonderful to you , you 're going to put your page , you want to say , for a short time , for a short moment of your effort , then you 'll see !
and if you 're not , you do your dance . it 's your dance .
you do it in all of these things .
i believe , and i feel like we should teach this .
so , for all of these things , you know , it just to do that you have a little human love , and you have that for you to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
marcus !
last year , i 've come up with these two slides in order to realize that the journey are going to close to 70 million years , and it was about 40 percent of the bottom of the lower states .
but this is no longer very strong enough to do this particular problem , because it does n't show the cost of ice .
in a sense , space is able to be able to have the direct heart of our global climate .
it grows in the winter , winter , in summer .
the next slide i 'm showing is an idea of what happened in the past 25 years .
the eye is covered in red .
as you can see , on the dark stage it is the male ice in the winter , and it 's in the summer of the summer .
and that means you can find five years or older , is almost like blood , that 's out of the body , right there .
it will be taken by here , in 25 years , in 25 years .
this is an issue , because the global warming 's sequence is to make a cause for the arctic ocean where there are large amounts of food , which is when it is going to happen from services into the moral services .
so compared with the entire amount of view of the atmosphere there may be the amount of double when we cross this critical time .
now , in some of the most a couple of co2 emissions in alaska , methane depends on water , out of the water .
professor of the university are placed in china , another one gives you some chance in a different winter on the last one .
wow !
you 're fine . the question is , what 's going to do with us .
and one reason is that this huge heat up from the north , the north .
this is a year trick .
but the business industry are much larger than ever before .
this is the presence of the river to the game .
if you want to know , what sea comes down through the ocean , you 're going to the sea .
these rivers take a lot of equipment .
on the other end of the planet , the larvae , the largest region of ice on the planet .
last month from the researchers that the entire continent now have a negative trick .
and the ones that come up over a few eye is particularly strong , particularly in the camp .
this is 20 feet of light away , like greenland .
in the context of this , at the context that is ice , you see new farmers a few years ago .
40 percent of the people in the world are half of their eyes out of that galaxy .
in the 1990s , this is the glacier , this glacier is the eye for this town .
the oil have themselves , they 're moving with it .
but if you 're doing , most of the drinking water is going to be on .
in california , a 40 percent of the eye was seen by the eye of the forest .
that is where the eye is .
and the predictions they 've read , are serious .
and this eye in all of the world is moving to a dramatic increase of fire .
and the quad all over the world are in one really business and did n't stand down a place before ,
many so many years now in the last 30 years such into growth .
this is actually a complete trick .
so if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
and in the past five years of co2 , we produced that all 24 tons of them would be produced by every 24 of hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans .
so look at the area of the eastern pacific pacific right now from the american continent , and the american continent , where it gives the power decline of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest individual factor for global warming , next to the next , which is the 20 percent of the fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the hidden problem for a problem .
the united states is one of the two ones together , together in china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot of the eye with that .
but we begin to see a change .
here are the fact that we were born in the last years with a couple of green alternatives , with some green alternatives , with some green alternatives .
but there 's happened there 's a political experience in our country .
and there are been spent a local one , a little bit about the last , a last one to make clean coal , what 's already a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminds me to something .
by the day , we walked around the day when we heard at home , and a billion tons of eye is out of home .
you saw it right in the news .
this is our entire country in america .
that was about the age of christmas .
one of the voices of dolphins at the age has been this one .
there 's a trick to the face of the eye , it 's fun .
it gives it in the way and lots and lots of in america , and it grows to grow the economy .
so , the trick is going to make each day a day .
it 's done , and he 's the fire , and workers remain playing into all of the bread and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful justice is the director of moore 's face .
let me realize you 're a very clear , al gore , who are , of course , eat by harry , they do n't know what they 're talking about .
so the epidemic of autonomous water lies with electric open to life .
so here 's one thing , a part of her .
and at the presence , we see the world as a serious danger of your business .
so we have this up to the top at the top , we have to create a more more a commitment to the way to get the truth of coal .
the fact is , coal is not static .
we believe it 's obsolete -- it does n't think it 's good .
so , do n't worry about the change .
let 's leave it this .
so coal coal , you 've heard a lot of it .
so , let 's make a tour of this modern , sustainable force on the world .
it 's amazing . that 's pretty machine . this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the reward itself .
and yet the consumer company of coal 's interesting warming is the remarkable glamorous you see in here , everything changes everything .
look at it , you know , that 's why we have so you 're there .
finally , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge and our challenge the national challenge .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the khmer thread that all together is our minds is our face of mass coal and urban oil .
but now , there 's a kind of commercial solution now new way to make ourselves that out of these things .
now , it will take a 100 percent electricity new , within the next 10 , 10 years .
a plan to do back america back to work to stop and helping the global warming .
finally , one solution to a solution , which is great enough to be our problems .
it 's the basic one . you find any more .
this is the last .
it 's about america from america .
one of the fastest ways , this is our invention of old , in terms of old life , in the earliest line of this world , reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment systems to create well , good surgery jobs to create good jobs .
basic america 's new . that 's the time to accept reality .
there 's an old african saying , `` when you want to be quickly , go away .
if you want to get far , you go together . ''
we need to come far and fast .
thank you .
i 'd like to start to ask the time of your childhood in the time of the time when they played with you .
as you realized , how to bring hands and go to the interview , and move out there and moving them , to think of problems and problems through the understanding of the understanding and change .
now , you 're going to think about making you understand the way that we can understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer , inspired , by the kind of interaction with our interaction with real objects -- together with my eye and the colleagues with my colleagues , i started wondering , what if we could
and the question was , really , was that , we decided to explore the answer and they evolved to study the answer .
in short , a trick is an interactive computer in the size of one another .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other ; you can pick up your movements , and you get a screen and a trick .
much more importantly , they 're physically , you know , they just only to be able to get their hands and move together .
and the eye is one example of a new generation of data in the world 's recent digital digital .
and then when those tools are going to get rid of the tools and create some of consciousness for your movement , each one of these things recognize and the lessons of our eye is clear , then we can begin with exploration and are starting with this .
i 'm going to start with some simple examples .
this is an eye for the presence , and if i get it up into the direction , the video is getting out of it ; when i do it in the other direction , it runs backwards .
and these emotional portraits are taking true of one another .
so when i turn out , it turns out that your interest in .
if you are surrounded , you notice that and you can get nervous , you can get nervous .
and they 're also feeling their movement and get their movement .
now , an interesting tool of the interactions we began to identify was that we could apply everyday genomes in the data , like color as well as with the eye .
so in this case we go to three , and i can use it , and i can use them around the middle , to put color in the middle , where they 're going to be touched .
if we 're going , we can do a little bit .
there are also some good ways in education as we 've been talking to math , mathematics or the mathematics , where we want to give people to people , we have to give the ability to see the results .
here i am -- that 's a company that i 'm doing with a simple trick with a very simple system .
this is a game with words , which is a sort of metal to the eye .
basically , you get every video every party on every point , and as you try to form words from words , that is going on about a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , it 's going to be the way and you 're going to try to try to try a new challenge , new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came at the media lab lab , and i could move it to this sort of time and took a video of it .
they really loved them .
an interesting fact in this type of applications that you do n't have to have a lot of instructions that you have to do .
all you say you must say , `` you '' and you know , '' and you know exactly what to do .
so here are a couple of people that test .
this is our ancestors here at the right on the right right on the right .
it turned out he was going to be at the time just to last one .
so for him , they were just killed .
this is an interactive trick .
we wanted to develop an online system with technology design .
this is fall .
it can bring new characters into the scene , by putting it up from the table that this character show up this character .
here he is doing the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he 's going to show you a game in the scene .
the top thing are coming up here .
good work ! yeah !
by using it , by the time , shake it , and you can put away the characters ...
... was to get your own story .
hello !
it 's a story of doing open finish , and he can decide how she evolved .
flying cat .
now the last example of this , for the time today , i have time to do this , is an online game business that we 've developed recently and in the order to be able to be able to go
each one has four different variations ; you can pick out what you want to use .
and you can get that sounds into the sequence you can put in your own patterns .
and they do it by being simply to have one place to a trick .
it 's the effects where you can change , you can change live , like , like , air and filters .
you put it in a certain wine and you get it to it .
and then the more unexpected effects of how speed and light you operate in the entire sequence .
so now we 're looking at this .
we begin in a series of individuals and these in a series of structures , you and add a little bit of the voice a bit of voice .
now i put a fake line .
now i 'm going to do something that does n't have done something that i 'm doing to do .
and now i 'll zoom on the window with the crash , so i can control the effect of the effect .
i could go down the whole sequence by using the speed to the speed or others .
and i 'll go on the window with the vehicle ; for a more more expression .
i can be in the sequence as you 're born with evolution .
i do n't have to design it in the first plan , but it can go , and they fall down the point of wood .
and finally , i ca n't see the whole sequence by doing the eye to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , it 's my desire to come up with new eye , which can go into our brains like our brains and bodies .
and today , i had time to tell you some of this new eye game and show some the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you the path is that we are at this new generation of view of the interaction with digital media and bring information into the world
thank you .
i 'm very happy for you talking to you all .
