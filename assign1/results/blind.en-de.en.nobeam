yeah , good afternoon ladies , my gentlemen .
thank you to talk about the end of the kitchen care .
and i have to introduce myself right now .
my name is peaceful software , and i 'm , strange , strange , awkward , with food .
that 's what 's called the years for eight years .
and my favorite is : first , the two organization , third , third .
so i 'm responsible for the presence of this city .
and yet you do n't make free stuff like that .
i know .
and that , and it 's something that my son 's got particularly like , i 'm in .
i 'm so the head of dance 's head of the game .
you 're doing the eye and the end of the eye .
and i have thought , of course , is an issue of it , i think , where i want to do with you today .
which happens with the theme of the field , because it 's the rocket for the dance .
we hope to the best and raise the best , worst , that has been inspired in the best time ,
you know him .
he was having the general end on the general time .
and then i really start to say something that is really very serious to a way .
i do n't make it .
so talking if there 's a risk that we have a risk that we are just a disaster , and we 're going to travel food , east food food .
a lot of people get along the road .
it 's really , you have it .
and somewhere on the edge there 's a lady , chocolate , left , to make something that , perhaps illegal waves .
no one seems to be .
it 's a little bit part of a suitcase .
a sudden a sudden of a keyboard .
leave it the game .
police comes , `` get a game .
people are calling .
ze sexual therapy .
go out .
what 's going on ? you know , `` questions . ''
we do n't know what you can say .
people rely on the building .
children cry .
some of them might be even fall because it 's all going to go quickly .
suddenly a telephone a telephone .
there 's where it is in inside .
one woman 's spread .
i hear now here here .
i 'll give the rest of your imagination .
but it 's not a fantasy i have . right ?
that 's what happened in the week in vietnam .
there 's a little bit like this , unfortunately .
afterwards , i turned out that only , nine pounds of drugs were in it .
but people were just like that , so a friend of mine tells me that from the building .
it was not said .
and it 's the same thing that suddenly , suddenly in least in least in least in least in least in least in least in the group that my friend was in my friend .
so thank god : thanks to the god you do n't have any panic , you ca n't really have as much as you think of any awful life as well .
you see , in a single single single way , in a representative disaster , it 's a very important thing .
communication is important because people in this situation are actually in communication .
you want to know what 's going on .
in the good time , in the good old time , that was the one for the stock still .
we simply simply said , or we stop .
why ?
it 's a so-called called the so-called .
you have a parent to say , god gets people in these , there are no reason or we say the mass of the mass mass .
this is the social media in a period of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of high and public school and public school , and public television no longer .
simple and amazing things because it 's not a moral thing , and second of all , anyway , though we 've been given the last as a plan that report over the event .
you may remember the local river , a few year , that 's already already come from .
the first chapter came on this ,
from someone who was on a body state and just , and i just went out , and i just immediately , this is an airplane , and we save people 's saving .
there was no time .
you see , we 're going on to be able to be able to say , today , and really , and i 'm going to say , and , really , it 's a truth to say the truth and have very , very scary .
because most of us are also the last past that we know the truth , because of course , we need to help , of course , we have only to get information to the information that we have just about the future .
in this , public media is public media , or private media either not as very much , or they just do n't just do it .
so , it 's going to be in food , and that 's also something that has been left through the media , and we 're thinking about how we deal in the future .
and we 're going to get the good old years of education .
however , however , just as a form of the eye .
and we 're going to be that in the next few years of a hundred years of the eye in the eye that , some of you are now familiar to you , and some of you know , you 're doing , when you 're going to go
so , it used to start with it .
you may know you still know what three times else , once long , it means long .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to be going to have the ones with everyone that we have about to go on to the place , the radio people , about the television , the radio and the local media and so on , and of course ,
and we know we need to very quickly and focus by ourselves and we need to get very well in there , and we need to get out there , because we 're going to get the glue and the citizens , you 're otherwise .
and we do n't even know what we want to say about .
communication in the crisis , or in disaster , is so , is a question of small things that are available with all the media that we have on . and it 's also a question of the rise .
the price is our biggest problem because the way to do it , and the citizens are either , it 's not going back again , or you say , you say , right , the eye is much worse than it is much worse than it is .
we 've done good experiences with facebook and twitter , even recently .
and you might have some of them to do some of them out of them .
we had a bigger place in food .
and that 's a so-called chemical bomb .
these are bombs that are on the eye with the first things that they do n't even want to get up with the first things , but in the second world 's second voice and only the ground in the ground , that a chemical tool , that a
the problem is , many of these bombs have never worked and are able to be able to be in the end of the food .
and there 's been an older gentleman who was in a certain amount of being saying , in fact , it wanted us to come now , now , he was now seen how you 're like to be prepared as well , and now you have the milk
by the way , by the way , several ancient years of gentlemen was doing all the test for the whole way .
we 'll see what we find more yet .
it has to immediately immediately , immediately , that , right , not copyright , you will be stopped , but it 's being called writing .
and so we have simple and simple and amazing , in the turn , they actually let , in fact , a bomb made a bomb .
and in fact , in the history of the city , the whole communication of facebook and twitter is doing with facebook , that the whole time is far away from the whole way .
and the media was a tough line .
we did n't even have to get with them , but they have the ones and get everything about the eye and twitter .
so this is a great effect for us because the price is going to be a lot of a social media about social media .
just because you have to give me a sign , i 'll give you a sign if i 'm supposed to stop .
i can not watch this in the clock here .
that 's the main effort because the social media has the advantage that they have the advantage of being eaten .
not so much , because it 's got members of the ones that are called or the ones you call it is a high you .
second , quick pages .
if anything is n't true , somebody is immediately immediately , so the apartments i 've talked about , is a lot of the whole community in principle in principle in principle .
and it 's a very high trick , so if anything 's wrong , it can be very fast to be being being being being able to be being being being being able to be being being being being able to be being being being being able to be
and we have a huge set of eye in the ones .
i said , `` well , what the exciting thing found out is a bomb on the face park .
so , from the things we 've happened from all the things that happened in the last few years , and there 's a lot more the trick you think about one time than one more interesting knowledge .
also the city can eat every day from such a disaster .
a bomb that has to be become in a park , certainly not one of those things .
but it can also , and also , we 're just going to have the farmers and then we 're going to find in the move and then we stand with our eye and try and try to follow the back of deep deep .
and if you think of them , you think about other cities , if they have to be stopped , they just have to be a call in the order of which you did n't want to look up with that , you know , now , we 're
and that 's important to communicate , because it 's really in a world in a world that is given to start communication , to stop communication to prevent communication to get it , to worry that people are being used to carry on this difficult situation to come
and the social media helps us also have the trend of being , because ultimately , all of the communication of communication , and it 's not just an infinite trick to the eye , and certainly still had a very much organic place , and certainly still had
so i 'm not just a task today 's not a task of the government , not just a task of the dance or the eye , the right , the right , the right , the right , the right , it 's on the disaster , but
and there 's shown that .
there 's a lot of twitter and over facebook if they were too much more with it , and also , of course , you 're all of getting more with it because suddenly , by all , you wanted to build any tiny building out of people ,
so this shows that there 's a lot of things , too , for public communications , is also a lot of the public communication , but the older signs , it 's shown , the social media , from a trick , not from not even think of
and i hope i 've convinced you a little bit of these , that this medium , which is actually in the beautiful things of life , also in a city , in a city , we 're going to get into the future , and i 'm now
thank you .
so , a beautiful evening in night .
i 'm a believer with different .
i 'm a writer and you 've heard the way you 've heard already .
and i 'm now also to get a personal game with this .
what it is is i really will make there , i 'll give you a moment .
before i do that , i have to get some things .
the first is , i think we really need to live with life .
we do n't get life without any stories .
and i think that there are a lot of eye there , right , with stories than the science system is actually produced .
and i 've got to think that the internet , the most large ones that will actually get up with any good as anybody is really going to get up .
and four , i think i believe that people were created to be creative , to build creative .
and that they are happier , once they 're creative .
the more people are happy , the better thing is going to be the world .
forge it does n't sound .
now , these are the world 's world , though , is only an oil .
first , i 'm like i 'm said , oh , ted .
and the story that i want to tell , is to tell me of education in a context that 's just happy to be a happy bit at the moment .
so that 's the end .
and it 's the open birthday .
now , it gets off by the missing principle and the singing not as much as the moment that it 's on education , something happens with her .
it 's happening in your head , your body , with perception .
and she did n't really have words for this .
she does n't know what happens in the way .
i was a words for it .
i call this the magic virus .
you can see on the one side and the drawing industry in the eye , and everything 's pretty black .
i 'm kind of feeling that i am a sort of voice 's a trick .
marcus .
and on the other hand , we then have the two of these two , these guys then put in the country at all color .
and it 's like , in the first time , i said i 'd write better and write as i 'm going to teach .
so , the first one , which is , with your new perception , is an social man who says , you see seriously , and says , `` thank god , your life is over .
so that 's the end .
and there are a whole special kind of special kind of people .
she was born as a while .
players are people who have to play their eye in order to play their lives .
who 's telling you know ?
nice .
imagine the working way that does n't do the work on this to do n't meet the way you meet , but you 're looking at the pocket .
so , we 're getting , you know , the game , everything .
what 's really important is that the player have n't even even insight on the light .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish , for everyone , we just do n't know .
it can be over and be over tomorrow .
and so , an game is also like this .
you do n't know you know , you know , how much you can do that .
that means , and every single minute could have been last last .
a player who has its entire set of state , in the moment of the eye 's moment like a philosophy philosophy , which is going to get the end .
now , of course , you can say if that 's dangerous , so if you 're dangerous , why do n't it play at the way ?
and the answer is clear : it 's clear .
without playing , without a way , it 's all about gray and only if a player is playing , he 's actually alive .
they were born for playing .
that 's how it .
and this story of the eye and how you now are the world 's world to make your first challenges , and of course , of course , you 're going to fall in love in the fall of love in love , that 's the story i want
and in the form of a eye ,
the first letter has 12 consequences , and sorry , here 's a trick here , i 've seen too late .
so , 12 consequences in the first season with seven to seven minutes .
this kind of eye , a result of the eye , is to have beautiful contact with beautiful eye , you know .
the television has been on the television since any other .
it 's not new .
and if it would be anything , i now one is done .
and at all , there 's no other thing .
now , let 's go right .
let 's go back to go again .
what 's the most popular sentence from the film , or from a series ?
it can be one to one , right ?
thank you .
as if we had a break cut down .
and that 's what does n't do , my player does n't too .
of those that can be a lot of power .
there are so many different games .
think about you , you think , you know , go and so on and so forth and so forth .
and that 's how they 're doing that is that the number of players are also so good .
and we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of stories all the time everyone will want to be told .
now , the next question is , who 's supposed to tell you all ?
i already have a right , very high my opinion .
i 'm always thinking about visual intelligent and extremely creative .
but i know that a hundred of brains make more powerful than just one , even when it is mine .
and that 's why , right , it came up with the idea that you had the car pressure to be in the creative process in the creative process .
what if we just do n't just do it up or more to get , but even the way ?
so if you say , we 're going to be a very complex way to get to the point of this eye .
imagine in the result , you know , the example of the other three things you 're going to do is find them up in a very class , because he reminds you your grandfather .
and they 're also a huge fan of the eye .
and then you can just , you know , with the technology today , it 's not so hard to do that .
and this store is going up to the front where it then goes right right , and that 's really cool to be able to be in the really cool audience .
that means it 's not somewhere under , but it goes right right , it goes right where it 's supposed to land .
and that 's a beautiful beautiful thing that we 're on the internet .
and on the web , they can do that all the time .
so , every medium is kind of trying to happen .
this is what she called `` audience can write her , draw , turn whatever they want .
and if we now look back now , we look at this structure .
it looks a little bit about the web , right ?
this is what 's going to do in common .
and i really am really convinced that the internet was born to tell this kind of stories .
you only have n't , many , not yet , not people who do n't know .
so now , i 'm even doing one step on the other one , and i 'm going to be left the audience myself in the player .
in a interview .
you can see against the characters that we have a series of series , but also against people in the real environment that also have these eye on their mobile phone .
and you know , you 're probably about all very very very very very very very very very good , are like mobile skills and the entertainment entertainment .
these wonderful areas that are just getting very rapidly .
and i ca n't go on because i would need a lot of a hundred minutes .
we 're getting together .
everybody is an parts of three parts .
the first part is the trick , the second part is the right and then we have the trick .
with this interview , i was able to have a crash of the crash , right now , i 've got to see that the game is to convince you to convince .
i gave that the first prize for me to the first performance .
and i have to say , this is a dead factory center , from mayor of banks , the eye and so on .
so , you know , people should be , right .
and if i can convince that , here , i 'm with my writing here . the internet is really using right , is going to be organized , the world 's way to improve the world , and i think i can really convince everyone .
that 's how it .
everybody 's like this , why does this really be this ?
because in fact , all of the areas in this name are done .
we first have the trick . who 's the trick : who did it , i 'm an job , you 're not on it .
of course , of course , we die .
in a series of , there 's been a lot more dead .
everybody is in this , everybody 's dying .
and then , of course , everybody 's in the sense of everyone can be if he wants to .
that 's absolutely important to me .
i come from this with the end and there 's nothing more likely to be in my opinion when it 's going to be like this .
i do n't know if you know that .
if you 're in the theater , and then the actor 's going to the nest system and they 're like that , oh , god , please do n't .
and that 's not what this is .
so it 's so far interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can just be the name .
the reason i talk was n't a journalist that all the project is going to be in a german .
that 's also a couple reasons .
i 'm going on with this project that was going on , and i was always asked , and let 's ask the whole way of english , as bigger , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah of blah .
so , just like , the german is the third eye is the third .
the one is the english , you go to the hair and then a german .
so it 's not like we move in any small dynamic .
and also , i really think if there 's also other people like that as i think people are grateful for something that became a common deal to any eye and then had been being an breath to the end of the end .
if all of this is happening as i would have been , then the first is now at the first two eye right now .
and if you ask , why me i 'm here to be in the eye , where it 's going on , you know , there 's where it 's going on in the front of the teeth .
so i 've done that some thoughts i 've done .
i love the game .
not just the game .
i 'm just a pretty moving swimming work on the eye and the eye .
some are also having some eye and get it out .
and i can only only say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and it 's incredibly , incredibly much .
but it 's not using anything that 's not that you do n't even know it .
and my project is just the thing i just have taken everything i 've learned .
and it also also have .
and so far it goes good .
i can just say to the real one .
so if someone like this , i 'm going to really help me of my part of my part i had an idea of character or myself , and i 've got a idea , or whatever i do n't think it 's already going to go .
you 've got a lot of the internet .
on facebook .
great how free your vote talk .
yes , i also call .
welcome to be welcome . can memories be ?
question to you .
can we accept memories ?
can you remember what happened in your life ?
have you forgotten yourself even the point ?
who has who can remember anything ?
it does n't go up hands .
so you can get memories ?
apparently .
thank you .
no , that 's not that simple , we do n't want to do it today .
and then the talk is probably a short talk .
again , good evening , my name is samuel 's name .
the talk today today , i decided that , because he got two of my favorite song , or my two major teeth right now .
i was standing at real york , and i was looking at the rest of the world and the brazilian prize , the way that we fly in the world today .
and with certain of time , i 'm also running as you are as you as well and put it on private and companies in the private and the company .
so on one side , i have a lot of times a lot too much too much , on the other side , i 'm just going to go to the human eye right now , how does it work how it 's the human ?
so how do you change that change ?
so these are these two things these two things .
i was recently recently a very interesting discussion in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , the sand area .
so , the question was , as can we , when we can build a computer , and we can build a computer like this , how do we work how the human brain works ?
so , and i 'm where there are already quite close to this .
so i think like this two , three hundred years , longer , for the longer , not a lot .
but let me just say , why do you think that 's a little bit about it .
so , at the point between the computer , between the computer is the one side and our brain , on the other brain .
if we take the computer , we find it all , so their partner , their travel system , you 're able to take your own eye and all the smart talks somewhere somewhere somewhere in a very game .
it 's called the state of state , which is the central eye of an infection .
these parts are together from a certain common transistors .
and the word has been heard , and in the end of it , it 's always going to be a hollywood test .
this is a little bit of little device , which has three peace and they 're doing not getting electricity in scale .
in our computer in our field in our field of our own field , we have been able to do some extra , about five hundred million of these little parts .
and they 're getting rid of the online line of travel .
we 're doing things we do n't do things , we had to say degrees , einstein hear , yes , yes , the world computers can be much , but it can actually be zero , but actually , it 's just a person 's compare zero and
it does n't get more .
he actually is quite quite an x-ray of birth .
let 's compare it out with our brain .
our brain has been as a given unit of the u.s. , the size , and we have it also , there i have , and i do , there 's a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons in our gray
so the beautiful thing that our neurons have not only three connections are only about three connections , but to do it into a rock .
and that makes a eye of what it is , just because it 's a trick , 10 trillion .
this is 10 to 5,000 soldiers .
so , there you see the complexity of our brain to make a little bit more than what we 're currently computers .
let 's compare the time , maybe the one or other things , the first ones , which are their own power on their own , ha the first way , and with the market market eye has been able to help in the end of the eye .
our eye are still focused sometimes , but the box takes about 20 watts here .
and it 's the equivalent of two major bananas , so you do n't need more , and you 're going to be running your computer here .
now , if we 're doing normal good good good good good , normal data with you why we do n't do , why do we do that ?
perhaps that , one or another one or another , the light that works on the internet , that 's what human person is only 10 percent of your brain , are you going to be able to be able to make the eye in the game .
and there are a little bit more the advertising to a little bit .
ten percent of them may be , but our brain is in the course of our evolution , which was a very , very small , at the middle , the only ones , our eye has been around , everything else has different has
that certainly certainly is n't what we use .
why does it feel so that we can make the most part of it as well ?
you might know the term of the climate system ?
and i remember , `` you know , '' and the way that i 've been with the printer that i do when you see the oil , in the ocean , you will be there the top , the ocean , come out there .
and this 10 percent up , that is , what our instructions , our values , is running , but it 's about -- but a huge trick , it 's a huge trick .
we 're going to be able to make the transition that we are using with the face of our face to , right now , we 've come to build creative products .
and , to come out , the memory come out of memory , may know that one or another person knows with your eye .
people who are suddenly remember far more detail than i could n't have seen my head in the situation , and i say , `` i said , `` well , i said , but where do you know how to do it ?
and this is where we 're going to be a special deal of eye , so someone in the game , somebody at the most field , the only thing , who is , who is , who is , who is so good to a plane , that
and that 's not kind of like , here in the river , and there 's no , no , every single house , every single kind of house , every single windows he saw , he once got to paper , he could bring him to paper .
where does this happen ?
so why ca n't this this , well , the colony rate may be quite close to the game , to take some more access to its exponential percent .
now we 're using the ones that we are , but why ca n't i remember that are all the evening , in all the details ?
the street is that i have interesting about me who made it .
and he was working in the most part of a hospital care , and has been working with a medical school system that had completely been wiped up with her experience , that was no longer the eye , the eye from the brain , that 's not going
wonderful , so it came out very well .
now it was about it all the people to get to you well .
and it 's where they were in a very safe clip , or to this stop , even if they could n't remember any longer to happen to be able to see the head of cars that they can do , that people , they were going on ,
and actually , with this block of the world 's life , we have been with it .
the second thing i was really , really , was he had a lady in either , he told her mother , her mother , her mother , her mother , her , her mother , she used to read to her , she was small than it was
and she was sitting on her mother 's completely , and her mother read her .
and then he said , in snow , she 's like that .
then they started to get fat , she was four than that , she could n't read it , today , she can read that .
and then she said he said , tell me the end of the eye .
you actually have found a copy of alice in the oven , where exactly this was the lady to read to you .
so the brain has this page as it was a game game , as a picture of this .
and she could read it .
so , yes , we 're actually able to get access to , but we seem like we 're in the normal life we have to have a good deal of being able to do .
but now we do n't want the event of looking at , but as well as the game said , he 's a set of opportunity , we 're really in the sense of our own , so we 're feeling what we 're feeling on , a sense
and , it 's now a long evening now , you 're going to be really comfortable , but i 'm going to go out some little bit , and you get yourself , you know , you 'll ask you , you just close a little bit ,
and remember , you know , a very natural event , positive event in the past , yes .
take the first thing .
and , if you do that now , you may be aware of the end of this memory , you 'll get a visual part .
you may get them a picture , maybe even a movie , maybe ?
now , some of the things that they do n't just say , because we do so normal , but they 're doing it for the first time .
and if you see that , then it can be that you 're in the movie , you 're going to experience everything all your eyes , or you see yourself on a screen .
the one we 're going to be with , the other eye .
thank you very much . you can solve the thoughts , you can get to the eyes back to the eyes again .
who has a visual information , and then they 're high ?
yes , there are a couple of hands up , that is , in the way , the third of the last , i go , you know , i think that 's about what i 'd like to do is that it 's actually something that we do
well , go further .
so , the idea is that it 's beautiful to the memories when you 're doing memories , you do n't just get this memory up , you 're going to get a positive event , and i 've been able to see one of the one to one
and now , this is a result .
so there 's before you 've been , well , the way we do is doing the brain in the right , there 's no difference between what we are actually talking in , and what we think about what we 're going on .
and you can do that now , you put home at home and you see something in the future that you ca n't see , you 're going to remember similar information like something you remember what the last year was
and , you know , you know , these stories are like this in the house , from the time .
then , hey , this is happening , and this is like that , and the longer stories of all behind , the more long , the stories are mostly about the stories , he 's still going much more comfortable , because the night i had the night
if we do it in our mirror , so if we actually change our memories , why do n't we change that because we do n't go to the question , `` question ? ''
so when i came up here , my uncle showed me a picture from his body and i had my uncle in switzerland .
a very beautiful picture , it 's a very beautiful way of doing it .
just , the picture is a little beautiful than the ball of life , so it 's an beautiful dog , it 's a little bit more , there is a beautiful dog , there is a beautiful dog , there 's n't a picture of that
and why do n't we do that with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what do i do , if i do more beautiful what i think about that ?
they actually made a freedom in their own thoughts .
so you know , you know , there are some people who you see in the morning you have in the morning , if you just have so silly eyes , what is you ?
i did n't have to follow my bad license , the whole eye went through the head .
really , it 's the whole night , and this idea did n't come to me .
and i think it 's the other way the idea of doing it to the mind .
the son 's son , friend friend , i think he got little depressed when he came out after germany , because his mother stayed on the prime party , and he 's just terrible .
what the dad did was made up every night he left and said , or she asked , what was the most beautiful , what 's happened today ?
what was the most beautiful , tell it , and then he 's got telling him , he 's just telling him what today 's real happened .
and , within two weeks , there were great great ,
and then it was , ok , the whole work of the work is that comes from .
and the whole thing today is made about this whole youth 's talk about what 's made of , which is today to people , that i know .
so it 's not the memories that are changing us in the way we are , but it 's our focus to what we focus on the thought .
and how much energy we can carry around them or use it .
so if you 're going to look at the thoughts , or say , this was now called the practice , i 'm not , you know , you 're going to be on the front of the way you might have , you know , you know ,
what 's the heart problem we 're doing with , and , in fact , what beautiful , you look at that , you know , i get to see , `` i 'm asking me who are real , like , human , which was beautiful ?
and then they take that with the time .
take that to your interview , let me do that .
or if you 're doing someone to do any eye , you 're still walking up with your boss , or your wife , or your husband , you 're laughing out .
so , just take this image , you can go on a funny funny hat , hey .
so you 're doing with the background , let 's talk to the background , you know why you 're laughing ?
because they 're able to imagine , because that 's the time .
and they can deal better with the situation .
can it ever get memories of memory so much ?
no , i think our brain is , as much more capacity to do it all to do it all .
it 's not because we can choose the free , how strong we have the focus , and how important we have a event , a memory , a memory , it turns out to us .
you take my favorite glasses to you , you know , you play with the images in your head , you use your fingers and give it every day to get your life .
woman afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
if i asked you to ask you a party , what i 'm asked in my own time , and tell me i do with friends and go and turn me on the end of the friends and make me open eyes , and in my mind of the
and if i think about the mayor , to have a museum music music , then they 're moving out of the old social social social social behavior in the right line , and they sit long to the old space . very close to art .
frank cochrane once said about music as a way of architecture .
and so similar to what we do .
and so you can see one thing that i 'm talking about the same , i brought you a short movie .
it 's the movie .
there is this number of the end of the people that are being doing it .
this brings out the best thing in my view .
since a result , it 's a force from the eye , which is an entirely different thing to do something completely different .
we 're so much between the state and middle , at the end of the day , and we have very early in our youth , which is the incredible force and joy to the classic music .
we also have noticed that the expansion of the eye and the eye is about to have some joy to us , a little bit of a small way .
and we 're our serious belief that the state of the heart 's crisis is not about content , so on the music itself , but is on your eye .
so we can imagine the question , how we can make a game that the music is close near , the friends and the power of there are the way we like to do so much .
how can we organize a stick to organize that to work beyond the edges of the eye ?
we put the characteristics that you know from the classic sky , space , period , light , context , basically in question .
so , for example , the relationship between the audience and musicians .
usually , there are a gap between the main audience .
we 're trying to the landscape .
here you see a picture of our eye .
the musicians in the audience are in the audience , drink , by the drink , are when they 're in the audience with the audience , you 're playing in , play play , are one , two pieces , back in the audience .
and the whole thing is going to do this , in the evening , is a little bit about a bit of the night .
everybody who 's is a really ridiculous has come up on the stage and goes back .
or that sit in the sky .
in the classic , it 's so you do n't think of any or less obvious , physically , kind of like them here , sitting in , and it looks and listening out of the front .
there 's music , there are actually no pretty long at the music .
and we 've done ourselves , how you can do that .
if you sit differently differently and you can see to a online piece , you 're going to hear it a different piece of music , and then you 're going to hear it a different way .
and then comes out that we did n't have a stage , but four in the audience around the world .
the audience could actually be true .
and everybody was sitting at the first row of every time .
important for us is we 're not just just doing just any option , but we 're thinking about the music .
so we ask ourselves , what do it really , and the way of the spaces , is the music , of the people , is that the music is going to have to have so work to work how to have it be ?
and so , in night , in the clock , in the clock , 30 were 30 , was married in the morning of being being called organic , in some ways , in old the old eye .
but not just the spaces can make music alive and now , but also the connection with other people .
and so we 're totally happy that we 've been working with the interview together with the interview together with us to get smaller or movement to the time that they do n't actually have their dance at the same .
and so for example , then the way for `` you are getting smarter , are for example are steve rich .
and in this year , we have one , yes , if you want to do this , we have a eye .
and we put a radio with a concert together with a trick .
we have the story of the soldiers of the soldiers who are with trouble with action , called `` the walk , '' and just did a turn down .
and that 's what happens , because we had a big trick that was going to take us into this piece .
we have a very good amount of money from people to move from the people that we could get into it .
and this is actually a symbol at all , which is out of a shift out of a community .
we 're totally happy to the eye of the south business to the south business game .
because the city is that big , we find great spaces and exciting spaces for the world , but also so small that we 're aware very well .
when the year in the spring two weeks , they 're raised out of europe in the city , they just turn out that in the city more people that usually do .
the whole lady is becoming designed .
we 're sitting a legal resource from students and students , financial research , the ones , really , really , really .
and to turn a game , which is the eye or the eye and the experience of the eye , and seven to 10 parts in a interview that takes for a year for a year .
that 's also economic market market market market , but it 's a year for the time that is the time for example , or the eye who are going to be organized in some more hands .
we 're all going to all do all of our time and live in the way of germany .
that means the biggest part of work is moving around and on one in the eye .
only three times we make ourselves a mountain scientist in a mountain friend , and we make a lot that are the ones that come out , and also the human human being the human being able to think about the only important thing , if you want to
for the mayor itself come to 20 volunteers , for a few days , for a few weeks or some weeks of hands , there is where the help is going to be in the order , the way
and of course , of course , those average days , the monkey 's getting it .
now you could mean , you could have a little bit of what a toy need is .
but our eye goes on .
now , we have a huge community in the city , we built around around us , so that we 're going to stop in what we want to do .
this is also a bit of the classic eye with the example , but as practical things like , the one thing , there 's a little where we have a bridge of the bread that we have with bread or the way that we can get up and
it 's going to get that in a commercial park in the city there , over the city , and sold up .
so , the eye .
we 've found a whole range of individual leaders that can make us a living in the living to spend a square way there to the order to get .
and in this way , the mayor has become a little bit of different in this city and by the people in this city .
they identify in a very special way with this shark system .
since the beginning of the year , we were able to be able to call support the citizens in the place that now call the whole massive stuff to a single and sculpture eye now .
we 're sitting on the stage the stage , which is the classic 's poor , and then you see it into the right hands .
so we 're so happy to think that in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the very late young music , in your own hand , i take home to the cities , you 're in the cities .
now , if you 're not able to imagine , how about it as well as a sense of play music like that , and then you just get over .
next year , we 're again , and we would be wondering if they also are there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen .
you might be aware of the knowledge .
knowledge is learning or to learn , and i 'm talking about , to learn , i 'm a lot more , because there are a deal to collect the skills you win with .
you know , experience once a beautiful formula for the end of the eye .
what i learned from art and culture , well , i can say a lot of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the
and so i think that it would be really right to give this one thing to give another set of , what i 'm going to be doing with .
art is beautiful , but makes lots of work .
you now have those right now .
you get rid of the laughter , although most of the ones know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with it in the word that 's pretty much good , so we can not get right that way .
art , that tells us sometimes that what .
work says we 've gotten this , which is what it did .
sometimes we also sometimes .
the people who love to work , that 's what i did .
but in work , we think of the presence and the art of the rich , rather than the rich beyond the time , where we move in , our experiences , our experiences , our own experiences .
and so i have my student , which i want to show you , in about three hours of living in five online online online online online , all the windows , with a little bit , so it 's very simple for them .
it starts with the eye for a childhood , i continue to start inspiration , i 'm not going to tell everything from youth , not all of my youth , not a worry , go on , i 'm going to put the word images i 'd like
so for the first part of my tree of life and finally , i was in the first time , five , i 'm sorry .
so one of you will know these pieces of laughter that you 're familiar to now .
so you 're doing two and you 're doing that .
you learn them as well in the first two years , three years when you 're getting out , and i do n't have a lot of them .
and so with 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces on the piano , not far from here , at home , at home .
these pieces are life on a eye game .
there 's a tune there , and the other voice is saying , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's the right trick .
and this , ladies and gentlemen , that it 's all right , and if it is only two voices , put together in the present , the future that are sometimes , in the end of those are a game , which is the
and i learned two main main things , sometimes three , to play with the eye , at the same time , each kind of listening , which do n't get a period of time that are not in a period of time .
so that was what i 've learned for , among other things .
and one of the experience i never forgotten , and i 've had the worry that it could go to me today .
i have a piano , there were more people in the room that there , and in the mind , i came out of the eye .
i had forgotten .
i played out .
so again , from the front , i knew the same thing , i did n't go on again .
the audience almost worked out almost as i , because i went on , she was in my place , i got my notes , and i got it and i started the third time from the front .
and you do n't believe the way i 'm going to have me behind .
but this was a very heavy experience .
and maybe that was one of the experience that i knew , well , was well , even though i had a trick , i should n't go quickly and they could n't be able to be able to be able to be easier because of talking about my
yes , the next chapter of my favorite group was i 've got to teach you with inspiration and there 's what i 'd like to tell you .
when i was so , i went to my eye and told him , he 'd like to be cold , i 'd like to play a game .
and he said , `` well , blogs are n't going .
so you 've visited a lot of time , and you 've been a lot of experience with women .
now imagine a game young young , so young , i 've got to be a sentence .
i did n't forget that one , of course .
and i 'm not even involved by this .
and i 've been at the way , and i was at a interview at the way .
i 've forgotten , and i remember a situation that i 've never experienced .
it was the head of the gulf in the morning , and now i am now work to the part of the way , i just ca n't control one , and she was the most beautiful place to make the poor , and then you had to do
i mean , i 'm not able to play it , not in the piano here and i could n't do it anymore .
i have a couple of the two girls , and i suddenly played a random game , and i suddenly got it right .
and then i went to high , and i played in a hospital , and i still know that i suddenly go to a lot of all a sudden .
i was just myself .
i did n't get anything , and i did n't get the music with me so .
a experience of being where i 've been learned , emotions also .
and sometimes it 's really right to work that you 're going to be driving into these places , in that condition , i call it a trick .
where everything is going on .
we actually had this situation in the game in an organization in an organization .
so , almost everything , almost like the ones we did when we did the eye , it took only two months , where you would normally need a year for a year .
now , that was my experiences with the piano , with an artistic being creative , with artistic work .
and now i am here , i 'm coming to my daughter , and i 'm going to go to my birth .
i used to start a musician on that , but i was like a game game on the time .
we played off business , we have follow , and the game .
i 've got a trick and i do n't have just to be able to get my eye on the music on the music and the trick .
in the choir , we breathe in a while , they sing , wonderful experiences that i have very , very further .
and then there came to the theater where i was looking at theater into the theater , where the interview went into the interview and the state , and i 've got up with the golden system of the way i came up with this one , because because
and that is the art of the culture to come to my eye .
so here for art , but in fact , is not an artist , but you would n't say it , but you can go ahead and do something .
i was there in the theater , and i have a really , at germany , there was no really a wonderful thing in germany , just in germany , there , and i 'm there , i 've always been a little bit of the question , what
and that was why i was looking at the reason , and i was looking at my business business , and with this interview , i got yes .
but before , another one is a other interview before , and this one , i have been , yes , with interaction interaction .
so i came to the german interview .
the german eye has its eyes in the game .
i 'm a trick sometimes when sometimes i was born because i was born in a position , and i always say that the eye is going on , and that 's what i was , i have to do , i 've got a sort of
but i have a online root , because my grandparents were diagnosed and also have a free thing , and there , in the end of you , and i 've experienced the flow of the flow .
this was something i did n't expect to be what i was in , and suddenly i became living into a different form of culture , in a interview , into a culture that was lived in this particular device in this particular device in this
and as soon as the focus of the fuel , all in us were all the situation , in a very different situation , in all other states .
and i do the future of the future , the future , and the future of my friend and the colleague , and then we 've always done for the open night , he 's in charge , for example , i was playing with an example .
we have done the online to the eye , so , but of course , these are the eye , had been able to do the food prize .
and this fence , that actually came out of people .
it was my fate that i learned at the president of the eye , and i did n't do that the wall .
i was on the next day , i was , of course , classic johnson , oh , the wall is , yes .
i 'm going to be prepared to any questions on any questions .
and she was there , i was a technological technology for the cities in the south schools .
and i 've experienced the way to do the interaction in the interaction between two german cultures .
in fact , we 're talking about the same language , actually , music is wonderful and became beautiful , but a lot of them became the game .
so unlike the fuel , it did n't come from the people , but it was a lot of top , and that 's what i 've felt as a big , big media , here , i think , how the german identity , i 'll go back
and then , you have the age , you can see , in ?
now , also , the good way is , in time , is a much more at the power .
and then , i learned all the things that i have learned about , and i have noticed , in the city of food .
we 've had this one at the time that i had a trick , imagine what i started in here , when i was here , and he stood up on the eye for culture and play .
i still have that .
so , anyway , if you did n't write , you wanted to write and the culture and the end .
i was the first part of the eye .
so i do n't like it as much as well , i was a wonderful time that i had this interview , but they moved soon , because i was in love in charge of education and make care of it into education for education and design .
we 've done a lot of time in the bubble , we 've got that if you just have a more first of the back of the back , the ones we 've done , that we experience the right , the right , where you can experience interactions
many , many interactions we could be , and could design me and realized what this means is , if different people from different areas , we follow a goal together .
by the way , i 'll get that i get more at art , more for the culture that are about us , which are the more powerful between people , between cultures , and i 've come out of art in the
so interaction was , as far as the voices , the subject of the subject as we , seven the idea had the idea , at the u.k. , that would be done in january , that could be able to do the presence of europe .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter , he 's still a staff .
this word word has two key software , to one , i started to give myself with something , and i can also use it as well , say , i started , that 's what i 'm called , i know something .
and it 's always in its television television television television .
i know something with his heart training , i know , i started , or the way you started that or that community .
and i started to get myself with something if i go to this , and i say that to me just heard to me with that , i want to figure out with me .
and that 's a really big action .
five thought about three and a half million people trying to move , the way cities , in particular , it 's in common , you know , that you 're a community in europe .
and as big , we then talk about it , but anyway as a community of many people who are in a big study of life , but then when they 're in a big language , even if you 're a common language here , and this was
at signs , at the presence of the highway , many other experiences .
one experience that has been from the game have n't been out of the eye .
there 's the eye running to the eye and food , and i worked , and young girls out of a while , and young students from school , they have a sort of point of men , they 're in a little bit of men , were
and it was already an special effect that young girl had a young entrepreneur , and young , and young gore and then read young men from germany in something of a early german .
and then one of these young men in the piano and i played this trick that i loved .
and then , then he was looking at a letter and said , `` i 'm a writer , '' he wrote him home when a young scientist he played him , and i can never play more a good finger because my two fingers are going to be
and he 's saying his finger with a interview , and put in the piano in this piece of being released and trying to play the game .
and he did n't get him .
it was so `` a `` '' of `` a `` '' of `` i '' that i 'm going to lead to me , and i said , what do we learn ?
we learned , in the game , that many people can move together together , but we learned all things before we learned that we are going to be in high school , and we have a lot of ways to talk about the minds , because we identify
and that was for me an amazing experience , and you can see it 's not just about knowing something about .
it 's always going to be able to experience something and to win with you .
and if we make a lot of sensors and invention , the way we make it to manage art and culture , to provide our own position , and then finally , and finally , also working on our own identity , by doing art and new culture ,
and i hope that they still have many and you have this little bit .
thank you .
yeah , thank you very much .
i think we wait to the first picture .
so i have a close to support in the end of my own , like this to a couple slides .
but it 's no science slides , but it 's about my eye here , and i 'm here to find a direction and i get a subject , where i think that 's going to be the next few years to be more complex to us .
so through words , i finally know , thank you very much for that , which ted means , and i think in the area we can actually be absolutely a talk .
and then i 've had heard that you should think about the talk in english if , if you 're looking at , you know , if you look at it , you would n't understand what i wanted to say , i did n't know what to say
how we 're going to die .
i 've got to tell you that first thing .
so , patient was patient in the hospital that i would go to the eye , and i was on the front of those war on the line .
she was a old old , and he was always dance in may may , because she also did this out of her husband , which was the first man who 's been in war .
and so every year , it 's a year to dance every year , and has a way to get a while too much at a lot , and then it 's got to get on and has been able to see on the right side , you 'd
and also , it was also once a few years before , and i had a way that was in the same reason , and it went on the left .
and then , i was there as a doctor , and i was in the doctor , i have been in the care of the surgeon , where they were treated with antibiotics , and have a conversation , and i 've been able to make the discussion of
does it really make sense in some such people to bring a fat that 's available to use . ''
so , for example , to make an interactive surgeon , is that a human interview at all ?
and she 's been used by it .
five years later , i 'll see the name , the name , and i can remember well because he 's just so rare , and she 's broken in the same time , and she was broken in the way of the
so the question is , what do i like to do when i want to decide how to decide what a human question or what he would be to say or what would be to replicate on the face ?
and that 's a little bit about the subject of the experience .
so you see the presence of the way we 're going to die .
it 's a book from the eye of how we 're working together , a report in the front .
and then , it was so much strong to ask us , how can it go to work ?
you , and that 's the way you 've been reading in this book , you said , there 's going to come into the world , so the parts is always going to be used .
it 's going to have a power of work , it will also be much more likely to be lower , so for china , that was a big issue .
and that 's what it did like to do is basically the work of the individual , so something and a little bit , is turned up in the quality of the quality he 's getting built on the quality of the quality he built .
and that , after my suffering , people were able to go less and more like much more and more of one small trick , where it was about to be a lot of high contact on a level of high school , not the more about his work
and if we put it into the presence and medical space , then there 's a way of development .
if you hear about television , what doctors are eating , they 're in most of the client , they are the ones to do .
and that means something else that has to be a way to get what it has done is that it is to get out with it , so it is so being paid to get paid with it , and if it is n't being more efficient , it
and by this simulation of this , they 're increasingly increasingly at the presence of the eye , and increasingly , more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
now , a good friend of mine is actually gone to the studio , because he 's no longer wanted to tell that , who had a trick practice , it was going to see , in the studio , it was to be able to spend a doctor
the eye is mostly a bit out of the brain , and he was in fact , the famous age , the more old people that spread between the house , hospital and back , because they knew that the game was not known to do what people left
then , the hospital coming out , will become careful , go back back to the home , or in the house house , and will continue to get on there .
and this lady had looked at in a way when there 's so powerful in the field of the law , then i would like to put there , and i would like to put myself up here , and you can get a lot of noise out of
now , in the u.k. , he had to get to the language of being able to learn a hard , that there 's exactly what happened in the eye .
it 's also more used by dying in a investment .
it 's no longer the main amount of price that are important , but you 'll put it in a whole range , i 'm not going to get a person , or not a child when i 'm in the home store .
and then it 's the sum .
in the meantime , it 's so , at the third day , a conversation 's conversation in all days , and you have to be able to do , i want to go to the hospital or i do n't want to be able to get into the
right , i want to get a chance that i 'm going to be touched or i do n't want to be touched .
and this data then go to a center and there 's the doctor 's point , and it 's always in the ceiling market , and then , then the decision to this level .
now , if we think about it , that , in may may the may may , you know , was also on the end of those things , and you would imagine that the second thing wrote a medical school point , i would n't have a medical
and this is what my friend 's friend , who is there in the van , there is a lot of laughter that he 's supposed to deal with it .
the last thing , it 's so that there are a teenager that we 're going to be surprised to about a teenager or not , or at least , or the kind of field of them , in the case of hospitals , and that these field are
there are certainly a lot of hiv that are actually very good about that , there are very much very poor people that are used there , but if i look at the eye , and we might have about patients in the year , and i would say
the whole thing , of course , is clear to this , that whole quality of the world , is because of that , because in fact , in the last that 's the money for it , for the last people to be more sophisticated , and that
now , this is just not the reality , but you have to have two benefits of the ones and the eye , and you 're just just just just about it just about .
so the introduction of the developing areas of the world 's thing as a kind of thing in the kind of wide media system are in the kind of other market you want to pay , and so they 're also on the individual numbers .
and now i 'm going to come to you how to get this , so what we 're doing in the last , because i 've asked questions , and i 've asked questions , and so that 's just simple , that 's not easy to do not
and there i just do the eye and the article there to me , because i think a society needs so so so these , and even more effective structures that we 've done in our society .
and in the end of this article , what you see , is just to say , is more glamorous .
and the second sentence there is to protect them , `` is , can protect your own , '' right , you know .
and what was missing me is another one sentence in there that , of all , we 've got to have a single also one for the surgery to protect and out for free .
because it 's a way to keep itself out , and i 'm going to give you that in others and i 'm going to sort of like me and i 'm trying to do it in other ways , and i 'm not really thinking about it ,
because the last thing it 's been yes , even if we like to ask this topic , we 'll eventually get at the point .
hopefully , hopefully , with a hundred or a trick .
that 's also what of course , of course , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to say , `` i want to worry about everyone , but i want to ask you for this , but at some point you have to ask the
now , if you think about it , what i would like you , you 're going to come to the dots , where the last car car , what 's actually the five of the most important things in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is quite an conservative game system .
it 's the only , of course , of course , and then you 're the friends i have , who i have , to start to try and memes that know me and you know that i know of life , it 's the game .
it 's certainly the trust between the people i might have too , but maybe in the fall , or in a vacuum or a trick or a trick or a other person i can get in a relationship with it .
and it 's there 's many individual factors that are there , i 'm not going to go and look at it .
but if you look at these three points , you 've got a whole amount of tasks , as you have to live in life , you have to protect the last one of your own .
and then another factor is that we see a certain set of a eye , and i 've got this sort of a text here as text or like an example .
other people can help make these decisions and behavior that behavior , not meet .
this is my inner belief .
our dignity , can come out of ourselves , are our own self .
so it 's not the question of what other things are , who will do that , who will me be power , or to use or to use for me , who is going to me ?
it 's exactly to wonder , where can i be the more questions , where i can see in people , where i can do , and my inner life would be able to come to that i can deal with these questions and was there and i can
and if you say , how we 're going to work , then these those of the things that became wrong by the outside is a way to say , i was talking about my life , this mechanism
because no person can be a person , as i can see myself , and i want to see and be a way .
and i do n't have to say there in general 's eye or the ones that say , you have to put a design card and you 've got to have a design system , and you 're so old , thinking exactly if you want a genius
so these questions , i can just ask , in the last time , for a long time , to a long bit more true .
this would be the human posture of a living rule , which can be in me , and not the outside of the state that have the state of being the state , but that 's not a law , and the other people can go in and be
and to do that all conversations , it takes spaces , and there i have , and why i 've called this talk called , and here 's this talk , and that 's what we 've got here , and i 've been able to do the work
so we , we know , if we can go old , we said , `` dance a dance in may may , in fact , maybe in my maybe very high age of , that would be even a time .
i thank you very much for attention .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm going to get two things .
you know , if you first first being flat , you 're going to be a little bit .
it 's still a second second .
let 's start with sure .
this is a real stupid , not too .
what do you mean ?
are different people ?
or is it for an infinite enough ?
yeah .
it 's not good , when here 's one of what it 's looking for .
so in fact , but i just liked it for the ones that know .
we do n't .
only , we only do only this one .
and i would like to just like a little bit to the choir .
max , software , we know how to know what we know .
and it 's all sorts of at the way around the food chain .
if we 're on the muscle stage , and we 're having two to you , which is one of you who are in the example of you , in the other people .
we know , imagine , `` look at , `` look , '' we 're in the box of the box , which is a small little , there are three , and they 're three people .
we can zoom back if we 're called ourselves , if we 're in any amount of elements , ?
count how would we make it ?
that means we would only get people to get one , one , two , three , we get the production , we see three , one , three , three , three and three three three ,
what do you mean , yes ?
nice .
this works in the eastern beautiful wonderful , which works in large numbers , even though it 's inevitable .
but it fits .
so how do you even count it ?
so how do you even even , that as many people there are there ?
i 've seen , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
go ahead .
you call the little bit of the little bit .
you 're good , you 're not , not , now we 're on the day , and we 're really understanding that !
do n't , it 's very beautiful .
so , you 're calling that in a while , and it 's way as well , right ?
you take one , you put it on a chair , which is it from the mouse .
the next eye is moving away , everything is , all of these people , different people , are using different different people , no chair , no chair , are large and lots of numbers , okay ?
now we go into bird .
how can we compare two of a lot to each other ?
we would say one that one is so big or more than smaller than the other .
we could we make it ?
we would start starting to begin again .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is that if you start to count a whole long long amount of long , you know , i would just say they do n't come to others .
max , honey , it 's obvious , `` oops '' is , right ?
so , how do it go ?
pardon them ?
there is no sense !
she did n't go too right !
you 're on your other mate .
so now we 're looking at this one time .
it 's making sure that , you know , it 's been bad in them always bad , right ?
you see , you ca n't see the end , yes ?
this is what 's a bit here , you 're just going to be doing it .
for example , when i take the right with the eye , natural numbers , tanzania , we gave zero that 's zero on the beginning , zero , one , two , three , five .
and we would have , let 's a copy of this interview and you take a lot of these people 's lot of people 's much .
now , left for the moment , okay , zero , two , four , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight , eight ,
okay ?
all of the world all the most common ones are the eye at the most long time of the natural numbers , but on which the band is the ones , on the other one 's the computer and the eye , ok ?
we call the one amount of being able to be the world theory , we call the other amount of being able to pay that natural numbers .
what do you think ?
is an ancient powerful powerful , it 's bigger than more than more than more than more than more than more , right ?
right ?
but this is very robust , yes , where the one is a lack of a lack of a lack of a lack of a missing ,
who is there can have different action ? ''
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , really does n't really plan , yes ?
it can be no , yes ?
you can n't , where are missing you , do n't you all do n't matter ?
okay , okay , say smaller ?
would n't you think ? do n't ?
so this is the general thing you 're afraid is wrong , of course .
and now , i 'm going to tell you why the amount of thing are the same .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we 're out of it .
we take zero on the straight amount of light , and we take zero on our natural crowd , connect , out of it .
the next thing zero , after plus two comes up , one comes one , and i 'll go back a trick .
the four , the two , the three , the eight , yes ?
you can also turn it too , then it 's clear , it 's right ?
and it 's totally clear by the eye , we can make it that i always do , in the state of a eye problem .
and here 's one , because it 's the most obvious thing to and the band is long , yes ?
we 're doing the natural ones to get the ones , the ones are away and the band is still long long .
that 's it in that it 's too much .
so if you learn some of them , what we 've learned today , we 've learned algorithms , yeah , what 's forever , i only finally know ?
an infinite amount of a property has been a quality that is not a quality of this , in the muscle community , and this is absolute is more at the muscle is more at , a real one , a real one that 's exactly as big .
you do n't do that in the heart of the heart , you know , from three people two people , then only one one , and before it was three .
yes , so we made wild amounts of time .
is n't any more alien ?
okay .
then we 're going to make a second part , probability .
the wire , are very effective .
here 's a paper .
at this experiment , i 'm sure i will n't know a third , and do it , what this is , yes , yes ?
so , we call the doors a , b , c .
i 'm behind something else , i hope you 've never heard .
and you want to have a guess now .
where do you know , i was hidden out , behind a , by a , b , c ?
guess what , our eye is , here .
you guess at c c .
who 's got another idea ?
a big ?
who 's got an idea ?
no , max , b has an awful reef , not , otherwise hear yes never off ?
right ?
it does n't really matter . so you do n't want to be mine , you 're in fact , you 're in the three letters , and i 'm looking for myself .
it does n't matter , right ?
it 's totally clear because the chance that they are lucky is now the third .
max , there are three things , it 's really not a matter , right ?
now , i 'm doing this , i just do one on that .
well , i know where it is .
so , somebody 's got here , leo .
so , i know where it 's called , and it allows , and it 's called the same way you call it a second round of play .
so i 'm really now the game i 'm going to now make me now , now .
so it 's so , we 're going to go into a second round of play .
now , suppose i am , i 'm going to do a , right ?
so now i 've got to show a very good door behind this , and it 's not said .
because if you 're b right now , i say , and i know , i do n't think it 's because i think it 's b .
and then there would n't be a second round .
then i say , `` go out of the mouse , good good .
but i have to , yeah , this is a computer record , and go to the second .
so i can only have a kind of an open system behind it , not that it also are not said what you 've said ,
now the question is , and this is the very effective probability of the state here , under the condition that b is open , and it 's not behind her now , you have their last chance to guess new .
you 're not allowed to stay right now , i 'm going to go a little a set .
so i 'm going to do this up what you want .
or you say , i 'm going to do c .
now , the trick is now more likely to know anything more , is that knowledge ?
all of them , very beautiful , b , now i know , it 's behind c .
or , thank god he 's very much open open , i 'm always going to stay on , that 's it .
or now you would say , you know , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we have , we
what do you mean ?
it 's not no matter .
marcus .
why does n't it ?
nice .
why is it it be ? right ?
yeah , exactly , that 's wrong .
that 's almost nearly than if we were going to go yesterday , `` if we could see it '' ?
but this is how she 's , you are a new one , fun .
so , like , the thing that is , is okay , yes .
so this is all the understanding of , i do n't know , six and six and yes , i 'm not going to be a copy of that , otherwise , otherwise , i do n't have any more likely to see , andrew ?
so , there are actually everybody .
behind this door , it 's a third .
and it 's always one third behind a door .
you can guess what you want , you have the two thirds you 're in the museum in the museum .
that means you could have a little bit of the fire , not , you can not do that with you with you , you can be in two dozen , you know , you know , if you can predict the zero , there 's that we 're
but here 's only a door .
so now , two thirds is not what you can do .
so , the two of them , but it 's all the door in the door .
it was not .
so , what 's more likely ?
well , actually , i really have it out .
so , what 's more important now ?
it 's better to stay or to change ?
it 's easy to now , yeah ?
of course , of course !
so , that 's not hard , you know ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they 've had pretty tough writing to their mind .
why ?
it 's easy to two third , two of the third , two percent are not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for everybody .
thank you .
mr. the ] me , after a lot of phosphorus , who are here of the same diet and bad food and out of people , the unexpected ones , they 're completely .
but i got my best , that night , it 's all gone , that kind of connections .
i come from doing this , and i was doing 12 until i 'm not at the end of 12 , i did n't really have a nuclear war .
it 's already , like this , right .
it was yes .
so for instance , i 'm going to have a invitation .
i grew up in the near near it .
and i do n't know if mr. people came to ask that my way to ask , to ask , if i want to get to the ted in ted , and i want to talk about a little bit about it ,
i have the end of the word .
sure , motivation is n't bad and i 'm going to say the woman who said , maybe that 's the one or another .
and i also started to have a full thing .
and i 've even been going to go to the rain night now , and i would have been in fact i 've got to train my morning , because i have been in three weeks , i 've got a little bit at june , where i 'm
so i do n't talk about this morning , i do n't think i do n't see tomorrow .
so who 's going to be , if you go to the morning , tomorrow , come on , i 'll be your very cool .
i 'm in [ the one i said , well , just i do , i do n't get to trust about the subject .
and i started to be some extra , with the theme of the subject .
no worry , the beautiful , little , blind trust , is going to come up with .
i did n't know what 's a little bit more , when i am the best , how do i know what i do ?
so there i come from six houses , thank you , many are some interview , and some parents on the farm is apple 's solar company , and the end -- and what you 're doing is the power you 're doing : beer .
trust , in sports , not in the mind , but you 're in and beer .
why is i telling you the story where i 'm from ?
for me , one of the most important stories i really do is to go as well as a planet , from the village , from the village , and grew up with two great brothers , with the oldest brother who 's the eye .
and with the second brother who 's the same thing as i .
it 's called the light and dark , who can also recognize where the windows in the room , if you look on light or , in fact .
now , what 's very practical for the oceans .
and , you know , we both can see if we are something about .
in the street tree , i still say , `` i 'm not going to be able to say , '' to be a man 's disease .
the old men , virginia .
all till it goes to clean up .
but what was the key of the key , of course , is the fact that i 'd like to trust and get the fact that you 're just going to get this huge trust , which is that we all need to make sure that we 're going
and it was , for my parents , he was very sure that many of you , before my brother , and i still have no blind blind .
we were so the first who then suddenly a whole suddenly suddenly .
and then , they had to sort of , had to make it happen .
and , now , i 'm going to talk , it 's a huge happiness that my parents , as farmers , not all the day that i have to stand next day next to us , or say to us , `` here 's max 's , ''
it was made that -- we have so a home now .
and b 's open our parents start to us , to go back , and then there 's where our end was being brother .
so , in the house , gravity goes to that point and the game , it 's a risk .
there 's the blind brother that i then do a game game , high farm , i think at high farm .
the very complex complex i have so much as today .
so , with the large brothers -- they 're not just good for their memory , but for the ones .
and our brothers and my brothers and i , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i
and this is the most popular brother with desire with three years , and then we did , of course , we were going to be michael -- michael and i wanted to .
and then have you started to drive with you , like many little children , today , that 's the game there 's the game game .
so , the way that can do .
but we started with this still , at the time , no one .
and then the big question : how are some good lights ?
and how do you get the trust , one of the things that the children are going to go back from the sky and the other thing , and the trust of us , we do n't have to drive them .
and what was our solution , of course , is a single of our parents saying to where are the ones , so that 's a car where the eye is where they 're also any extraordinary things , clear houses -- they do n't come away , and
and we had to be in the grid to us the one on the one that the one will hear .
and you can not see that we can not all of this , because otherwise it 's going to have so loud , you know , they 're not a little bit of anything that anymore .
but you can say a night at the light , and you want to go on to light and put yourself in your bedroom , you still want to have the same kind of thing .
you can try to try and just get your eye with the tongue so , and you 'll see , you know , that is in ourselves , people also , as bats , you 'll become a resistance .
so the bats are going to be the way you 're hearing , now , the wall , and you 're going to get resistance because the sound will be different .
and that 's the trust for me , so trust movement , always has been quite important .
but you can have a high game of these things , and the security , i 've got the windows chance to help me a way of play out .
and just to help me care without a big self and clear , without the ones who have been already , of other life have been already .
what i 'm unfortunately of course is not any pictures more pictures , which i 'm very close to itself , and one of our eye also is as children .
and this is from the back , on our higher building in our higher farm .
and i wrote this guy : the solar system is growing up with a eye of diversity .
and i was in the first part of the `` very literally , '' i was to be as a person , which i think too later in the interview and the trust of the scientific side is being a thing , or i never am as white as
and he never read like that .
but also , to do with what , of course , is not everybody 's getting this more exciting and so on .
and the diversity of the things that is of our strength with the most difficult to the point to know , and where i am good , what i did , where do i really have a deal of doing these
and our brother just again , who was michael , and always took me over the house .
so then i said , okay , so we 're here to be here a trick here .
there 's somewhere that you can do somewhere in a complete window , you can see somewhere , to the one at the end of the time .
and the palm company went along , michael and i , you know , i probably played some of the girls , `` oops , still know some other , '' i do n't know .
but at the end of her , who does like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i 'm on the risk of being , we 're the generation of young women , but not .
and i 'm always waiting at this time .
and then the consequence , the consequence at that at the moment , all of us , at least three , the dad at top , and the dad with a free answer with no open guy with no answer no longer knew what he should think
because trust all of it is , of course , when other people ' mind .
so the father would say , in order to god 's , help , help , help , the danger is relatively big , one of us would have been afraid of us , the danger that would be , i do n't have -- somehow -- somehow .
but in fact , it 's never happened .
he always had to be so close to us that he has a slow slowly or a clever of death that we 've ever brought us up .
and that 's what i found for me for myself , that we had these possibilities .
but sure , there 's no worry , which is not a key , not a need to make you get yourself up later .
for me , the different class of the different years that i believe was important in my life , all , many , yes , interesting .
and most of all , they were all about this , because i could see what 's been , where i call my borders , which might be my favorite hair .
so , i never had never to have become good with .
i never had the ones .
and i do n't like to go up to the end of view .
i 'd like to go up to rain .
now , at five degrees of like you are in the moment .
rain -- but yet as you 'd be inside as being inside .
but i always discovered the trust that i discovered that i was discovered , i think , different and different things .
so , first of the first time , for example .
and that was pretty beautiful because it was the shark that was us in the end of us , said , ok , we have a little bit of these , kids are now , but they 're going to be sending up kids some blind children .
actually , it 's good because you 're building one of each other 's little things .
and then you realize what the other power does .
and there was always my big trust , of course , if i 'm going to go to go to go to the nest , you 'll get hard to go , because then the other one might be to be what i do n't .
so , there 's just one technique , and that 's what the trust is in my baby .
and a foot a foot put me in her business school , and i put in , and then they were sitting with my online head , and then he 's at the back and the nest waves are over , because it 's the full source
i do n't get it here here .
i had my way to have to have to have the trucks , but i had it .
i mean , i 'm now a little bit of the stuff .
and so , i would have been a volunteers now , right ?
self-deception .
mm , i 'm going to be right .
okay .
the next thing i 'm important as a sports thing in school , just in the end of school , and just to get to the interview and just get it to the interview .
my parents were home or are to get out to the day , and they 're teaching us with children as children .
but for me , i always want to know in school , how can i actually move a lot out of school to get my own work ?
and i then had an opportunity to make a way to go into school .
and even though i thought , well , it 's all you 're boring , because there 's something like that kind of like the military language , so i love
and i used to be in the first day , i do n't know , in love , i do n't know .
i then said to the point , well , i do it , i do it .
and then , then , then , then , the first thing that was called the following , and a man , again , that 's the big diversity here in the sports , because you need an average , you got power , and it 's so good
so , you probably have a lot of work out of work in work ?
that 's what it is the trick .
you only get to quickly , you know , if you 've got the full trust in your own technology .
if you think about the trust of your own , the force you then are , you know , is that you would then also , in every conditions , the weather weather , to the order of the hippocampus , as you can also bring down .
and if you really feel trust in my case , i 'm in the team .
because as a while with the people who sees nothing , i 'm of course to follow the eye .
and i 've never been looking at the very proud of the talk about today -- i have to use the word -- my favorite -- there 's one -- there 's only one -- has done my practice today .
but do n't matter , we 're again again .
now , as i 'll do it , i 'll just have a little bit of them .
so , you go with one , one , one of them later another , another practice .
and what i 'm going to do is also going to trust the problem with the principle , which is that i think that i have the audience to imagine how it is like , if you just look at nothing to do with you and make it with
you 're going to make the game that you have , you 've got two pieces in your hand .
so , sure , i do n't have any hand anymore , otherwise i could n't have my head to the eye and feel that you are so much .
not .
so i have to help different differently .
i then run in my own telling .
and he 's doing a feeling of voice .
so , it 's still going to do the difference with that .
and that 's important for trust .
so the head in communication , in the eye .
and the trick says that if you go to the end of it , i 'm going to go to you and the end of me , and then i 'll go on to 11 , and i 'm going to know it easy to the left , so
if he says he says , on 10 little little bit , `` left '' and when he says he says : right , right on a decade .
okay , everybody understood ?
then , the problem is , i have to go up , or he has to look for me , i certainly know , i 'm right now , right now .
and to me , i 'm the very big , critical key if the eye is going to leave me , and then i have to really have to say , i really , really , completely , to say the negative to it .
to say to the positive , what he is is the tools that allows me to be really fast , and in the end also more than others who go on in the same way .
and i can only do that if i do , with both arms i do , you can go on to a leg , and i really have to make eyes -- ha ha -- or can you let it open , i can be open ,
and then i just have to go like that , and then you have to stand back to the other leg and it 's just a little bit of hard , but it 's actually actually actually going to be quite a quiet thing .
just , high shoes .
yes , and that 's really important to me , if i 'm in the eye , how do i go to say , so i 'm going to say , because i 'm just looking at men as a trick , where you know , you know ,
so that does n't know what to say he would say .
so i 'm a second , he got to open the way to the communication .
and that 's like a guy call in every call .
if someone does n't know he ca n't help me of course , but i 'm asked , i have to look like , `` well , i 'm going to have me to do that , you know , the curve were used to have studied the curve
or i need to worry about you like now , that you just are , how long the mountain is still going to be because if we get involved in the front of the time , there you 'll have been , you know , now it has to
and then again in such like a more job again and the thing just does n't hear that .
and i 've also been a pilot , as it is , as it is at the smoke , is to go back to a point in the front point , the front look at me , we 're actually having a 20 and a half minutes of us
so i 'm important about this , for me , i 'm really , really , really , to have the good to deal with the end of the eye .
i want to say , here 's probably others , you 've got to do with the online step as well ?
who 's going to get who to get a more more ?
so my best time , i 've been getting faster , but it 's now in april , and now in april , i 've never said so much faster as you 've been eating .
and in the meantime , the scene of the right forest is quite eye right with the way
and for me , i said , are really really , can then be able if i 've been open my ears .
the other thing i believe was that he sees about what he sees was and there 's so you have to have a chance to do my risks in the same main main main main main main main main main main
and that 's one of the most important things i say : trust with a rather training and not this conflict .
so , you know , you do n't like the blind now that now , frankly -- to be honest -- it 's in the end .
because i 've had the experience that i had a voice right and the left left had studied .
and then , that was bad in the time , because it was a story that 's three feet of view .
and i just just get the three feet in the same time .
so , it 's that -- as i said , that 's the time -- of course , you get off .
and i also know that because the game needs to turn out , so to make it look at .
and i happen to just happen to the point that people say people say , the left and i say , `` oops , the left on the left .
so then , right , is there , unfortunately .
in fact , in general life , it 's not so much .
but sure , in the situation with pressure , you probably know that you 're all going to be all the work or college , and if it must go fast from the time .
then , of course , i often often often challenge to you go very hard .
but for me , i mean , you 're very , very trust with what i 'm going to know .
and i 'm going to be honest with that , and i 'm a guy who does n't see , relatively in the advantage of the advantage because i do n't think about my risks in many ways .
so i 'm pretty much everybody at the end of the time .
we 're going to go from tree tree , from the fall of tree , which i 'm going to be , and i do n't go out and that 's what i do -- and i do n't get good pages of the good pages as well .
and then you can get it again when this is what trust is there .
and if you 've found someone who actually really get a hundred percent or so as i need .
and i 've also got the same goals in front of that .
because it 's in my theme , in me , is the next , very important thing .
you have to have the same goal and i really have to get clear , what does it mean it really does n't want to trust ?
because , the thing is , it 's a lot of time you use it .
i 'm doing trust that or you 're doing myself .
but that 's what 's really important , it 's already a lot out of it .
you know , you 're going to be a lot of trust for yourself .
and you also -- because we get people all the eye with the eye -- we want to see sense from behind .
and the meaning , that is , quite often , we just do , are able to achieve the sun and bring together together .
that we 're doing -- in my case , for example , on a few yes , weeks , weeks , i went to the interview .
and i 'm doing that right now , i have to look at somebody 's , i think , or i 'm in the case of the way that i can trust that mountain is going up .
and how do you do the mountain of that in the mountain , you know ?
well , i 'm sure , of course , the high advantage i had the only advantage i did n't think of any things , if you get a hundred feet in the age of my instance .
i was relatively unhappy .
so , you can be able to be the advantage of fear , fear is not a problem .
and i 've been looking at it again , now , i 'm going to be here about the eye here and then , and i 've been able to have the eye in berlin , and you 've got a lot of in the berlin online , there
now , this is a very little bit of the time , if you 're sitting here , and you hear the car , you do n't even have to see a lot of , knowing , you 're going to get there , if i get to go
and those are things that i 've been interesting forever .
sure to the interview also , you know , i 'm going to focus war from the time , i 'm so focus on , and can just have it that you can look but also , be a real real new experience .
and that 's exactly what you 're doing with you are in the eye , because you 're going every day 10 hours ago , and it 's just just now , just active .
you go and you have a still stone around around , and less plants .
you take yourself in the front right now of the way that i have a lot of world 's world world world world war .
so if you see the same at the secret , then that 's about the last one that 's the trick .
that 's the only interesting thing that 's interesting .
we only saw the life away or just others .
so i 'm going to be a lot of the trust in the eye , despite my strange strange eye that he had .
because i thought , `` well , how i said faster , i probably get faster away , how the thing is going to get there .
but as i said , it 's very much about , because you 're not really as well .
and really exciting is then going to be difficult about it .
so if you 're in the top of the top , the air is historical .
or if it 's a big design that 's when you make some online design , where you make on the left , you know , right .
and it 's particularly beautiful , and if it 's , and everybody with touch with it , and then they all said that when the eye is , they 're already saying , `` now he would take me to the wire , so he really has a
because i was , as a single thing i could go in the end , and that was what i was doing , sometimes to make some sense .
trust this is a way that i created in this moment that i said , well , i ca n't trust my favorite friend , who was a hundred percent trust , i go to the course of them , and we did that with it .
but i need a lot of security to the security so that i ca n't have to focus on to what you can go on the mountain , you say , `` right right on the right , left on 11 left on 11 .
and you get there at some point , which is everybody .
so for us , trust , we 're looking at the connection , so we 're going to be put a rope on their pockets , which i put in my hand , and then i ran out of her point in the hand .
in the other hand , i had seen some of the height of the height of the lower level .
and she was only looking at the foot with the foot , or on her eye , or with her eye , that i 've just been known to just get what on me , and i did n't just have to focus on me .
and what i really showed you , really , is what beautiful is , if you clearly clearly clearly clearly , eventually that he just had this goal in the top of that , you know , as well as the gold , in the sky .
but also , it 's also so that i realized that trust that , in me i call , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're in the , you
it 's also the trust of the other place that 's how trust is working in this .
when we were in night , we were quite at the course of course , in fact , we were doing this in the front , and we were all of us behind the other seven people and it was n't that much of the us , and i
at the night , you can not see the girls see by the back .
this is kind of a way it 's probably known to .
and i eventually realized , i think , ok , i think , in some other , ok , i think , you know , their trust trust , really , really at some other skills , at some point , even a end of laughter .
you go back through night , you go to 12 o'clock , you do n't know the light .
this is actually , in fact , when you 're laughing , the air is getting out , so it 's actually not even more likely now .
and then , at some point , the moment that they said , `` yes , man , that was actually really wrong behind you because my idea was going to explain to me all of me , we 're doing all the time , as women would be
they 've been told all night , and the other group of the group was also in there , and then you know , and it 's just the only time that are just talking about it .
or i did n't tell her what else was telling you about the mountain .
and that 's what someone know , it 's a little bit of the way that it may have really , you know , we 've been before -- it 's still the same hour , the sun goes on .
and that 's what you can look at this thing that can look at the outside light rate , and it can be some of the way to make it happen , you 're also going to get to the personal area .
and to me , i 'm really trust by the little time and not been perfect , if you 're doing this , if you 're doing this , if you 're doing this , if you 're going to be the personal area , what you 're trying
this is , of course , in the sports company you 're in the gold , and i do n't really know why that is -- you know , i do n't know to test the value or check , whether it 's just going to be the value
so i 'm going to be in some point of things that i 'm in some expert here is that , in the way , that was a thousand minutes , was difficult for six minutes .
if all of the things real gold , i do n't go here , i 'd be on the '80s , i would get that one ,
you 're in terms of hardware , at least .
but as i said , what i said , you know , i think , they , what you get , why you 're doing this is you can think of what i 've actually created , and how i 've actually created what i mean , and how
and i was in my skills , but of course , but in the team of all , we all need , no matter if we were in our own , the job is always doing .
anyway , if you have , man or young woman , we need people to trust us in that we can trust .
and if we have a goal in our head , we actually have the goal in front of the eye and that 's also the best evidence that we could trust at the project in the project of our lives .
and if you can once it , you can definitely have it in other areas .
thank you .
for me , i think that 's the title of my talks that came out of your beautiful maps .
what i 'm doing , is the very eye game that 's happening as a result of general population .
basically i could be satisfied .
if i have a quick government on a scientific state , all of the eye is just about literature , to the eye , the online eye .
even everybody has a range of eye , and they have a range of time , office , the presence , where scientific issues , they 're sort of , you know , sort of end
every car station has at least a trick where kind of scientific issues are being solved .
even , this is completely , if you watch , what you 're doing about doing -- on some other and the presence of the kids with children with the scientific scientific issues .
every program has somehow a personal flying flying , but yet , but it 's like to be a computer 's eye story .
science is one thing that i can love to see that i like to read , but that 's not what the effect of the self is .
cool , cool , science is only somehow that way in the side side , somewhere , there are the symptoms , are the symptoms , right ?
in basically , you 're doing five minutes , all the time you do n't have a reality , but that 's cool , to be rocks ?
there , i can see myself .
big meaning , there i can be , i can laugh with the jokes , but it 's great .
that is extremely bad .
because this is a little bit of paradox that 's going to be able to use the future with these kinds of issues and things .
but , over a few times , nobody never do that .
i 've just studied some examples of this , like science or science just to have a crazy day .
now , a very bad tower , you built a nice tower , the architect , not so a way it was a way it was a way to put it up .
what happens is , now , now , here is , right now , that the sunlight is in this scale , i 've had a shared core , and then focused in the other level of the other days .
and that 's the press press , there 's a gun , unfortunately , a gun .
the other things that we 're doing the heat is so coal that this poor , the really long , long , long , long , long , long , long , long , long .
and there you wonder , such an architect , which does n't really have a little bit of time in physics , because i mean , is actually really a mirror that the mirror is focused on .
so what i found out is , in fact , is sort of is , is , is , in some example , where it comes to square to be a blade of wood .
and i really ask myself what has the more design or architect or -- or where he was wearing ?
now this is a very good game .
a economist which has the deep such thing to do with the deep system is to prevent things .
and i 'm now here 's a few years now , when this was kind of , in the media .
there 's been a train , because there changed plants , which was a danger .
genes was limited to green illness .
genes were kind of bad .
max , oh , there are genes .
there were moments where on the market farmers really have farmers , hey , i have a result of vegetables .
no idea what 's going to be .
so , yeah , okay , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can have any glasses we have to do about this .
but at the time i was still active in the lab , and eventually was a little bit out of my own , because i was trying to have these evil genes in my bacteria , the online game .
and so totally frustrated , it was home , and my daughter 's going to be said , `` oh , you do n't want it happy , what is you ?
i 'm : yeah , i 've got there for three days i 've been doing this for a little gene of change , and that does n't work .
this was what i 've been trying to explain , so a sense of a power structure , i thought , i thought , in risk of genes , i thought if i talk about genes , they know what they 're saying what they 're saying what they
and that was what i was going to be , so a certain sequence i wanted to take there in these eye .
but that was what the woman actually has .
this woman never has been hurt by her hand by her hand .
who knows what i 'm doing with , you know ?
genes is something bad .
this is now good 10 , and yet , somehow has somehow waste in the mind .
genes , that 's obvious to anybody .
i did n't read a lot of days , so i read about .
and then it 's gene , and it 's been free , and it really has been in our language .
so , for europe , a climate , was a climate one .
but does it have a lot of other corn , the most gene has been an genes .
another one , the change , is going to die on rats .
yeah , this was also a nice pump .
they 're not so old , and it 's just relatively no matter , which is what i suddenly do , i could have gone together .
anyway , if you 're the time , all the picture , you 're all talking from all over the way around .
so , the happiness for happiness is not so far to the power of the time , but i 'm afraid that does n't take a long time .
but this is simply what 's easy to be in the population , because it just does n't make the most important things .
but nevertheless , we 've got to have some of these technologies with these technologies .
now , now , he was just a trick , he was n't the big issue on the subject , but it will be the kind of forced to get the balance and writing what most of the have have a real , most of what 's really not
and that 's pretty sad .
how do we even come to the population of the lab ?
if we think of this little , boy , and the boy is in the lab , we have an experiment , we have some good things , beautiful , and he 's thinking , human , that 's the public , but
then this must go to the professor .
the boss , then who are then then , ok , cool , cool , is always the name of my name , that 's always important in the science , it 's always in science .
good idea , i still am n't in the public ; it 's going to a trick .
yes , they 're thinking , a oh , oh , great idea , great , because we 're doing a press station .
so , there we have a lot of a project , a beautiful idea , and then it 's kind of coming out of a device .
that 's then the game , yes , but who is ?
now these are just the top of the top of it alone , you 've already got a shared set of service , a common trick .
and from all of these are going to get the presence that are really cool to cool projects , then you have an magazine for the crowd , whether it 's more awful , the eye , the eye .
that 's the path .
from the ground , it 's going on , you continue to be on the ground , and you 're really , really cool experiments that are really passionate projects , in these places .
these are good times young magazine , really , are made good , is there are we 're free with all of us , right , but who is that there 's from the way that i 'm going to do ?
just the way that 's interested in this .
in the business , we 're always in the presence of a middle memory industry .
so , the people who 's going to really care about the wheel is the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
nice magazine , i get the audience , who , who they were interested in , and maybe maybe the idea of it , you might have about one , where it goes in these months .
i really want to do with the right game i really with that ?
the background rate of interest , in terms of interest .
this is now , this was yes , right now , i 'm looking at the gentleman out the name of the other eye , who read up under the circumstances of any other , i think , to keep it into the sense of doing that
yet , again , our future will only be somehow somehow to get somehow to get somehow if we 're the eye .
fourth , renewables , renewables , the skills , the ones are the ones that the name are not really understanding the way they should have somehow ready . ''
so my project , so is , different health , young , a very surprising way of sound out of the device , really out of being completely to separate from its normal eye , and give him a course of how to communicate science .
what happens is that a scientist i have a teenager , we 've been now known to great 20 years , and it 's the trick , it 's a horrible rule to ask him to it .
and as soon as he 's going to be mouth , and he tells about his job , he 's about a little bit of a little bit of the way back .
max , that 's scientists who tell you what they tell you from doing is something like that .
mt , listen to , you know , `` oops , a almost , of a same level is already as genes .
it 's kind of paper , which is kind of , oh , you do n't know what it is .
it 's really like teaching teaching , and it 's beautiful , and i think , in a conference and you can hear people , you 're going to hear something about , you can like to tell your eye , but i 'd like to tell you ,
where is the problem to talk to the mind and normal ?
so i got school , i think that i have my idea , which are n't as far as far in the hierarchy of the company that are still comfortable , that come out of how you 're talking about him .
that 's for everybody for all of one , and always , like , investors , who want to know what happens in the eye .
and eventually , this is also the telephone that we use because they 're actually going to communicate the bottom of them as well .
but that training training , that 's just one story .
i really want you to put a crash before , and you 'd imagine your project , you 're going to be friends , you know , to be friends , you 're called , in , you know , to be honest , and worse ,
there 's a quote , i do n't know if the real thing is , if you can just explain , if you can simply explain , you do n't really understand it .
so the scientists from the lab and they really really thought about how to do this , how do i communicate this normal memories ?
that 's where the story is a lot of place in the world .
so , it 's totally modern , in every university , you also get some more and back in the very basically one more years ago .
who will drive you to the university of the city in some morning , will be to take a talk to make a talk away away away from the university of the university ?
these are the ones that are interested in the moment .
i have come back to the interview .
so , these are the people who are interested in the moment that we drive on that and individual talks out there .
that 's beautiful , because any effort are made with the skills , all of them are happy , driving and that 's .
so i 'm going to get on a second aspect , and i 'm going to say , it does n't really have the eye of the project .
the scientists are going to do more than how are they actually going to make children ?
because many really trivial things too reduce to the very important way .
because scientists like the question , and how children study their world is the same .
children work very well .
they do something that 's going to run the walk .
you try what , what , does it work ?
so you fall up , fall , and there is n't going to work next , next to it , i 'm going to change some of the slides , doing it again .
children learn extremely hard .
these are really eye skills , the game and the eye , and i look at what 's going to change what i think has to change it , it works or not .
that 's normal !
but this have a lot of failure .
and from that point i think really work , when they put up the eye and the scientists in the neighborhood , in the environment , in school , are in the environment , with the school , there are a lot of experiments that children and the scientists
and maybe you might , maybe , at some point , that 's what i can tell you , the only hope , the kids , i think , i also get away with , and then i also get mr. skills that they are in once scientific issues
this is not somewhere somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in the newspaper , but his kids tell him something that it worked with a eye that it has been a bread that it has there , and perhaps , and then perhaps , i 'm
and not only , i 'll get mr. , of course , mr. , but the trick is .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , the first trick i 've was said to the first time i 've got , right , so , you know , with our scientists that this is not about the same thing that i have in the right ,
a scientist does n't have to communicate .
yes , i think okay , i 'm going to call the next thing .
but if you get it in a party , you 're going to get up in a company , like , always , there are the next experiment .
thank you .
i am crazy . the question is .
you can not fly around every day .
the last few weeks , they were terrible .
the weather has made a great set through the bill .
seven , seven , eight years ago , i 've been asked if i want to take this .
i was the past , almost 10 years , where the online eye go in mothers and in the end of the eye ,
we 're right now , we 've got a far up .
had a thought of client .
and for me , it was really rather , you know , well , that is , in the mind .
what should that be ?
there 's actually ridiculous . it 's actually ridiculous .
i then know what 's going to be , and that 's what i 'm doing today .
and yeah , it may be a little crazy , but it 's also incredibly , but certainly , too , is really emotional .
it 's beautiful and it 's always exciting and big fun .
and i 'll just tell you the next few , you know , a little few minutes , a little bit of this life in the life of a eye .
i 'm a half of the eye .
the company has been since a hundred and a half and a half years .
i 'm a fourth game .
this company gives it for the two years for the two years .
and the eye is the ones .
the company has been on there for about teenagers or white .
the distance of the geese here is on the end .
duh ,
this is a picture i want to show you here , the little point right , that 's a red thing , it 's a body life , or something like , you do n't know , right at that point still up .
because there are just the interaction around around around the world .
and in fact , in fact , has just active 10 more active ] .
that 's what 's happening .
there are about 20 thousand active global world .
so , actually , in fact , there is no market .
it 's not a gas .
that 's a trick , a trick .
and the question is , why do you really do that ?
so how does this actually ?
so , with the point of time , and only in the ten ones we can talk about it again .
so a short story , a little bit of a story .
so there 's one of many crazy eye with the koran here is actually built this .
so , very short of the short .
and so , at the first time , i 've got some of the first world of world war around the life .
and then , in the first world war war , there was a way that was a number of eye and speed , all of the time were built in the end of the time .
they have , london , and they were going to be so london and so forth .
and when we get to the barrier and when we got them down and eight after the eight , and with a big trick to fly to the future , the english artist are taking the english , they get out of it , but not to be bombs
so , the story is in a curve .
and we had an example , an example , an example , an example , an example , an example , an example , an example , an example ,
but with you to do the client , it was n't quite pleased because of it , clearly , what we thought is , what the old memories of this was a old memory .
and yet , i was a very bad thing for the community .
but nevertheless , it was a good campaign except the weather in north there , many years ago , many years ago , it was very bad .
and we 're not working very much in .
then there 's the two 20 , the wild glass , has the distance .
and it 's got a trick that was then taken to america .
that has an myth in a myth that all german nation has felt about something that has happened to be something that was going to be a little bit of time , as it was the lower nation , and it was the lower way
and then , in new york , we moved with smoking .
and the whole german nation is dynamic , we are again who are there .
this is so in all the way in all the way that it 's a little bit of this device 's actually a little bit of this device .
but actually , until the ones are five , six , six , seven , seven , seven , seven , seven , seven , seven , are just built with the eye and the damage that have been touched .
meat , hundreds of hundred , where about the stone is the end of broccoli ,
but it was a myth .
and then the first live of life then was , unfortunately , to get out of it .
and next to the titanic then , where one of the event , where one product of the event , one product of the event , and then it 's called the more of a back .
also , the other devices were being replaced .
and you get to go out the last thing you 've actually been stopped with .
those are used to the materials that are used to the food game , the name , so that entropy lost .
there was nothing about the age of it for a long time .
and then the eye had the eye with the eye and steel who , who had the idea , maybe you should start this .
and i became an amazing designed because there 's been developed a great product , we 're just going to get in , but the market .
yes , he 's at the market at market , right ?
what 's going on here ?
that 's how it .
we 're going to talk about that .
so the eye is just to explain before , we may have seen the bright open , max , people have a lot of job .
there are many companies who have come out of this tool .
there are now now now in now , about 20 billion people in this .
that 's a real analogy , high media .
there 's a lot of behind it .
and i can also convinced me here and get up here .
so the geese in which they 're doing , is a normal plane like any other plane , but sorry , is the `` a gas , '' is not a way of hydrogen , and stop the trick with the eye .
it 's like a big deal and out in the water and there 's some people that have to make the eye .
the time is not there in explain ,
and a neuron looks like this , a structure .
there are two kinds of eye .
there are already here , that are us , in that case , the way that we do .
and they do n't have a structure in the middle of the room , and they kind of get it in a game .
these are the ones who built in the world , around both , in the world , they 're in half a piece .
and that 's what i 've said earlier before , i just have been in this case in the time , a number of our own , so there 's just the age of time .
this is what the production looks like when a of the skin will be much of a water .
the left is still once a structure .
and the one of the skin is also the ecosystem industry .
come from the eye .
remember : remember the needle .
so there 's the solar supply at the world .
one thing on a point of a skin school such as a skin .
and it has to be up to be open , and it has to be , because again , you have to go out , and then you have to check out , if you have a design inside , or a hole , or a hole that is
so , as you get the eye , and the same thing to do is not possibly control holes .
and at the end , a stick without the central system , it 's like this , as it is there .
so the monster is an eye product .
and this is what you see here at the one time , really in the front .
one point of nine percent , one of nine percent , one time , one time , six percent , that 's called a thousand thousand , a year , a year 's little bit .
that 's very little , very good .
that 's a trick .
and you can see there .
but there 's another trend that worry about us , and i 've taken up here .
we had three years ago when i started in three years ago , when i started to go five , eight years ago , eight years ago , and last year , i started at there to a point of course , or you 're doing a eye .
and this year may be in may , we were at a late percent .
if you want to go to the eight years , my years of windows , with this eight years , you can tell , at least in those eight years , a state of the eye , you know , in that eight years , the weather was actually
we 're the ones .
we ca n't fly through the middle as well through the microsoft .
they want to see that with what 's going .
and that is the eye , and it 's been trained every year .
so a little one of the piece that our weather is n't only felt , it also felt disaster , because we 're going weather every day , changes .
but because that is so good now , this is good to make the moon on the ground , almost 10 million dollars and we 're a lack of that program .
i just come from finland and more morning .
the main thing is now these days to share , a flying flying lab .
so , you can say that means the campaign .
and we 're doing the presence of the sea coast and 48 meters .
that 's the name of the limits of the place .
and the jewish t t come to italy by italy after the census of the gene in the eye are saying to you .
so over many hundred months of this is a lot of hundred months , and the air that air air is like a little bit like a little bit about how they react to our things that we do on the ground .
so , i just explain , we 're just the second stage right now .
a great design .
and it 's when you want to be limited to the theme of weather .
so this is pretty good on .
and here 's a couple of an gun dance .
the top of sweden is last week , and a trick week .
and in the meantime , by the weather 's , is great , of course , is 30 degrees , and it 's great .
the artistic thing would be like to do that again .
i just got it wonderful there , i saw a beautiful short days .
and then they were n't that bad either , they were n't so bad .
we were also in africa .
and for example , for example , when you were the end of them , they were told , you know , volcanoes the japanese is the japanese , the `` plastic , '' are by millions of years .
but you can just ask yourself , is that , africa , is then the way of the brain , you can , to ask your questions , to an idea for an idea , that you can make sense of the film at the film 's film or
i 've asked myself , well , what do we do ?
and what are we doing there in there ?
at the end , we were done ready after two years after two years after two .
and then the nurses went to go back .
the whole eye came up then and the project was sent up .
and a smartphone has the mayor at the oil that i 'd expect that he could n't stay down at the same .
but it was n't so bad .
we just had good insurance there , and we were actually very happy .
this was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with that .
yes , what we 're doing today , is a quick eye view from the deep deep .
what we 're doing today is this , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions growth or being .
what we do today is the eye here in the game .
we do some of course , of course .
we 're going to have to get the monster .
you 're making that 's breathing .
and there are always the same devices in which 10 , 15 times again .
we 're actually using the whole eye for almost five million dollars .
so with the clients , we still talk about this .
we do we have to make the user constantly to do the user .
we 're a plastic trick to run by the germans to control and control from the european solar organization , and they 're going to all the way , in fact , how do they do or the ones as well .
and this is also , right , and it 's getting money and it 's still going to be getting further .
the question is , do you do it on ?
do you want to develop ?
do you make bigger demand ?
there are up , you have some set of eye game .
what do you do ?
do you go on the market ?
do you go on to the stick ?
and of course , we 've also come to the time now .
and there we have suffered some of the things that we 're getting paid .
as by the way , i was sold by the way a couple of the food got suffered and lower was dead .
at the beginning , the transportation budget still went the amount of eye .
the population of the german population has been given to the back of six million users than a zero than the fourth driver was , and he was in the world 's bus a accident .
and it 's actually the presence of the eye at all the time , and came out the other companies , so we did n't go back and do n't even know , and also other companies would not be there .
we were in tokyo , the game .
we were , and they hear , in san francisco with a client .
and there was a very serious killer .
both of these projects are unfortunately ,
so , with the end ?
at the same time , we won a game .
and i do n't have an image that because we did n't even show that data yet .
but just in america now , the trick is the presence of the first eye in which we 're going to be done .
we 're sold three pieces .
so with the power of us , we 're developing like a partner to the technology .
and that 's a big success , but at the same time the failure are just in .
two customers are essentially in the very successful , because it was not .
why did n't it go ?
we actually know that .
either was not the place that the place had to get too far , or in america knows you 're made for the last 30 meters years , the advertising .
the national people have the ones have the driver , they saw , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you have one , again , a trick that makes you power .
that 's where the fact can not , you can be able to get out there .
and it was actually twice difficult to get this over the marketing : hey , people call it and flies .
good at all .
the street roots , a year , is , in , you know , `` well , '' are the food line , the safety county .
but last year , we 've only been able to get out of weather .
and there 's a second time , half a million .
that 's bad .
the geese are running in the chest system .
it 's sense of course , of course , is beautiful , and if i look as the ceo , you see how the japanese get out and laughing and all the laughter , and we basically do n't make all the food , because we have come to
and we have great surgery .
and i 've got to dance , and i have to go down with the mistake that we 're thinking we 're resilient .
you could still do more pants more .
we have such a trick at the end and be resilient .
but that 's not really true .
we 're also doing advertising .
this was a project that was a project that 's been wearing the head of war .
and she did this with the island with the island .
but the trick is a harder market .
and you have sometimes other people too well . do it advertising always to make sense ?
we have no enough advertising , but the internet has a lot to have changed the way about the start , because the eye control .
the trick is largely in the , so there is , today , is just 10 active in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , which is the end , three has bought the 10 you 're active .
so then we 're six of 10 .
we then think that we 're going to be going to control the market if it 's actually a place .
and hope to get a future again .
and what 's at the end of david , the founder of the apollo was arrested , and five , he said , `` you know , you 're going to the presence of the walk on the eye .
so , it 's beautiful .
advertising we find beautiful .
we do n't find a customers .
so to make it , we find great , has a technology value .
we have customers .
this is not even yet .
it 's like you go up , you 're off .
this was a physical physical object until you get the box .
and then there are no years of all over time .
there 's also weird , and hard for them and hard to control .
in every case , that 's the situation , the end , a point in the world , so it 's not not a market .
still we continue on .
it 's a icon of the region .
the ones have the force to make it .
so you just imagine the question : in what shape we continue to continue to do ?
how much money do we give us to the global economy ?
what do we do for this here ?
what kind of form is to have the factory form ?
and i personally , i 've been asked to say something , i 'm in my career , where i wanted to go up with the big , of the big , they , you want to step up with dead , it 's also about saving
i was also at the three years i 've been saying , when i saw a sense of an glass of marine music , and i saw all this whole line , and i 've seen this kind of thing that i put up my way .
and then , there was a trick about environmental engineering , which are in the money , and not knowing what they should do , and almost was going to be gone for it .
and there she was getting me to beat this .
and i 've been inspired on three years than the ones , and now i do this in hope , a long future to do in a long way .
zero , right ? fold seconds , i 'm still done . thank you .
gisela giardino
yeah , thank you very much .
these are my three dots that i want to talk about in the original minutes .
why are we in the successful or the road industry ?
how do we make a toothbrush ?
and especially , what do they do ?
what is there ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a little bit of a millimeter .
but it 's also the most important thing to show that challenges .
a few years ago , i 've been to explain this even harder to explain the way .
that we have a problem today , every child .
we have trouble problems .
but it 's still worth going to be in this , the challenges population for the example .
all sorts of eyes are exponentially 's size .
if you look at it a single long time , the oil for you , for example , is a very short one of the peak in the history .
we do n't think that it 's kind of different , it 's kind of a different way to go up and go up .
you know climate change , which the last step is the past .
some people say that , in fact , there were a huge time , we 're looking at the last about years .
you can look at this as well , but i also do it .
you can say , who needs to have to who needs to be away ?
you can also say the sea is a far away .
but it 's then , when you 're still busy a little bit of the way you 're doing , you know , real challenges , things that really avoid it , otherwise we have a trouble to the eye , the health .
it 's called 30 degrees of 30 things .
and there 's a degree in our cities like in nuclear engineering or in a way , increasingly further now .
but it 's also about the eye , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas where the big increase is born , and the trick are all about that in close to close to close from the himalayas .
the rest of all , not around the planet .
the planet is the trick to what we do , and we already have a lot of larger crisis .
and it 's basically about the people that are really living in the way in a position very unusual lives in the way .
it 's about the loss of biodiversity .
the bubble goes out .
the wings will always get less .
this is the sea , where it comes from our mind of our cotton .
and that all come from , where does that come from ?
these are all of these bad things , which i tell , `` i 'm sitting in the global form of wind birds .
in fact , what we 're going to do in a whole place in earth , what we harvest .
not only , they 're the oil and the traffic workers , but the traditional resources are more sophisticated , but last is the rest of it .
and we 're supposed to look at the watch that we can use that way as possible to produce past and to produce more waste and emissions .
so it 's about that this is in the 1990s that was in the 1990s , we 've been told all the whole ego wind to the entire field of the
that 's not just climate , not only , two , two , two , the end of a car to be a really different place .
that 's different .
our technology completely new .
so if we take a moment to grow down and get , and you can still take the earth 's societies that live in principle , and there are so life , and there are a huge amount of resources per year is a year and a year .
and then , in a interview , it was then , in a interview , three to the human history of human history , three tons of tons .
it 's four to us .
so these groups have come up with this local supply
and it 's very , very expensive distributed on earth .
it 's still more than more than more than more than the earth is in the earth .
and in other parts of the world , you 're very , very , very much less .
and what we 're coming to do , we did the impact for us , the rivers , the air , is better in the last decades but it 's basically basically a matter of that we 've been brought in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world now , they 're still going to be less like .
and therefore , the conflict we 're going to be , which we see , from the ground , is always the way you look at the flow of the american genome , and you see where the resources come .
and this is there , there is particularly a particularly figure , which is , there are a lot of resources where the game are the eye of the world .
so if we want to make it down , we need to get off with the subject .
so we need to change , the green boundaries are everywhere , the eye is everywhere .
and what we 're here to do here is to do that that 's not so doing it in the game .
this has been a classic artist in the journal of an international social park , as he said , the world has enough enough for everyone , but not for any case in any act of reference .
and there we are , like this , we have a lot out there in the average of average .
that 's how it .
that was the most famous part of the way .
but i always find you need to understand that it 's worth worth to change what it is .
even if i would say , it 's a way of living in the way , or life , which is more attractive .
but it 's all over the state of state , you need an interactive , i guess .
so , what is a fantastic portrait ?
and we find that in our rich parts of the world we 've been doing , that we 've been able to share the way we 've done , are the cure of life , but in charge of living , still not hold us in charge of living
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know people , who are n't really as well as this story .
i 've written this guy .
so , climate change , the same cause , have the same cause .
we work too much too much .
that 's one side on the end of ourselves , and eventually it 's too much .
i also love to work .
and the other side is actually doing this out of these things .
but what is a good life ?
how can we define this ?
now there 's a little scientific sphere , and it 's coming to a little scientific set of scientific industry .
so what i said before , and what i said to say is really really about science is in , but here 's what it 's going to be , how can i first define this , right ?
and there 's important to understand what life quality has always got two aspects .
what quality of life has has quality of the objective conditions as i can go to me .
did i have a roof about the head ?
did i have friends ?
i was relationship with that , i can sense in life ?
but just how does it go so how do i do ?
i do n't go to the sometimes of the quality of life .
and then i 'm going to get two stories that are important to the point of the place .
one is a need .
the needs of the most fundamental dimension of development is the most powerful dimension to the other of our development , the most emotion .
if we can fix our needs , we are happy .
and needs can not say , needs or not sustainable .
so , needs to do the need to do this , do n't move up with the net .
what are the need ?
you can quote different scientists , i 've been called two .
and there are of course , of course , is physical needs , but also needs to be a need to help social relationships .
we 're going to give you out , to push , you see , to creativity , to the slums of the service , to freedom .
that 's what a bit of the things that you do with money .
but it does n't really , but the question is , how can i draw it in my life .
and there i am the second important term .
take the strategy .
the strategy i use use to do that is to meet me that needs .
and then , the way that it 's the most interesting thing , and you can do it with a high school community , or a low community .
i can need a lot of money or need some money .
so , strategy , i think are my behavior like i 'm going to be my needs .
this has done with my values with the resources that i have .
if i do the money , i do n't know what i 'm doing with my needs to be as much as if i have a lot of money .
it 's the first time to think that 's the roof of your head , food , and then the game in the eye .
and then here 's the thing , this is the time that can be a lot of different groups , that can be a kind of sustainable or eye of a eye .
and if we 're all the whole strategy that are available to me to solve my needs , i 'm talking about a lifestyle .
that 's how it .
this was the kind of scientific life .
and now are we so far we can do this ?
how do we go like this does ?
and there just be some evidence of the evidence .
of course , everybody needs to find any of themselves .
but the evidence in the individual species is , in this , here , to where , i mean , i 'm a lot of , i 've been talking about technology , and eventually , in some political species .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so , where do we want to go ?
the slides at the beginning , in the beginning , is to use the danger , we 're going to use more resources and use more resources .
the other move to the quality of life because the effects are more worse , and in the last hand , the effects are going to be back to beat .
or , if we go to this , in a different direction that are actually less likely to happen with less , and you 're much more quality of life .
there 's one of my favorite eye , maybe i know , you get him from the end of the subject , you know , you know , you know , more quality of life with fewer to fewer and fewer .
so , there 's a lot about technology how i can do any single thing that we use here using here , the orange chicken , the coffee , the coffee , the coffee , the traffic , which can i make this so ?
biologists today can produce different , i can build the house from wood , etc .
to create more and create more and create more and create more and create more and create more and create more of the same quality of life .
my other teachers , i think , is that , very obvious , the game , the game , and there we have been in the , which is now been been interested in , because it 's very deep to look up on businesses .
where are the needs ?
what services can i can mean ?
and how can i do with a little bit of birds ?
it 's not a bit less with you , you 're doing with you , in the end , to the end , you know , in the end of less .
there 's a lot of examples of that .
in coral culture , we 're supposed to be made a tower with 20 things .
and as seven as we went to go to the eye .
it 's essentially from wood .
you may have been able to do that in several years if you 're going to take it in over over over over and then in your pieces of light and not , you know , so much less resources , you know , you know , at the
it 's also a lot in our own , kind of , in how the game are i in ?
in asia , wrote a nice book , please written .
so , where hard it shows you that last day is really coming out of this dry way of this is a dry .
the ones , i want to give me the other hand , and then i am at the process of a research room , and i 'm in this run .
you guys , you know , you guys , you know , you have a name , which was very quickly , and then i 'll be able to get the new way to do this .
i love the eye , they all know .
when i was growing my back ago , we wrote letters .
and then you can wait at the letter now , i 'd like to write email , i 've got a match with that little time .
for that , i write for hundreds of email for that .
and i can afford to do a lot more .
that 's productivity , that 's economic growth , we 're coming back to it .
but i did n't really have a really time to have been able to do that .
i did n't know i was n't doing a little bit .
but there 's good examples , slow food for example , where i 'm not really at the quality of the eye and the fun of the eye to the foreground .
and with a very nice circle of life , with you .
one of my favorite is the favorites .
there 's basically what we 're sure today , today , was the time , the average person in germany , was in germany , we were doing , in , we were doing that , in , in order in the home .
you can start to count a time .
if you were two , three generations per hundred thousand things , you had , you had , you had , you had , you had , you had , to get sick .
they 've done it .
we have to make ourselves for ourselves .
and they 're increasingly coming with that with this whole options .
and i need a sea that helps us feel these very few things .
i mean , i 'm interesting , you might have been able to go to the spaceship there , i think , i 'm going to call up , where , you know , not any thousand things .
the next example is using using you .
and it 's true of the cover .
star , you know , maybe in some course , maybe 20 years ago , maybe 20 years ago , we 've been developed in an kind of years ago in an two years ago .
we 've actually use more people when you think about yourself .
you think about you .
so , in addition , the business just just to work with how you can the things that we have already built these beautiful eye skills that we have a few hundred years ago , and still , still , still , still , and more than the more
what that once was going to do was just to use that better .
so , at the end of the end , this is a question of justice , right ?
i 've shown you some of the things that are : you can take it as a picture between africa and europe and a final world .
so , in the way , all the same time , at all the time , the same way of life can actually be able to be able to be in the way that they can only get , if we use less less less .
and that 's not less quality of life , because many of us have already got too much .
but it 's a important task of the economy , the company , these products , these services , really for us to do to make us make a good life to create a lot less resources .
last thing that i 've got about is to do the big policy with the growth of growth , and i 've had that .
if you read a little bit of the view that you read , and then again , is again by the pack , is now the game will be back to each week that these are going to be listening to the bottom of that .
it 's called , yeah , a crisis is happening in front of the door , and as one thing , what we 're doing , is what we 've talked about with economists , and that are busy with us , and here are the numbers of times
and there 's no reason to have growth , like , like i know of my youth , from the last few years .
part has been in mathematical reasons .
one point five percent growth is as much like eight percent of growth from every percent years ago .
and the eight percent is what china has today .
and they were just about where we were about each years .
in a total , when the cake is more late , is harder to eight percent .
one percent is still a lot , so we 're going to be good at it .
but you have to hire on some of the time that means you do n't mean we had to grow zero growth , whether the next year , and eat and eat income , and income income cells
we can invest in good to do that , we can work with it .
and that 's not so fast , because you know that statistics that growth are n't at the growth right now .
the economy grows , but the quality of life is in montana 's life that we are in the classroom that we are .
and by the way , it also can , and it 's also possible and all of the way that it 's not as close as we 're going from the ones and how they all name our own crisis .
that 's just simply true , and then you have to get a time of the economy ,
and it 's also coming and more and more , and more importantly , as a result of what comes up with form , and next week , i mean , i think , in the trend , you are in the trend , you start a bigger story
already , you know , the so-called was used to make his nobel prize in his eye with the former prize , that he said , the good economy , the good economy , the good economy are the good life .
and that 's the last time , at the end of the day and not not a complete basis to create more , not just about to do what we 're not going to go for our countries anymore .
for instance , it 's been for the countries and these countries also for china , and it 's the most other story .
and that 's only going to go out there are still that you grow , if we look at the level there , and we kind of like this level of scale , on that high level of life and economies .
it needs politics .
it takes to be goals .
it takes the waste needs , say the economists say .
it does n't really need to do growth , but we should really look at it and measure and ask questions , how do we actually have with quality quality , is that what 's going to go ?
is that a weapon ?
we 've been looking at our politicians as well .
of course , how is the predictable quality ?
so how do you all do ?
we need a very fundamental aspect of being the local body at all , and not the work .
who particularly who 's particularly , especially the entrepreneurs of them , but the ones , you know , you know .
so what 's kind of a lot of control is that , we 've got paid to colleagues .
that could be a whole different way .
and the resources are actually reduced , and therefore the resources are able to test the resources .
and you have to use one of the people 's telling people to create jobs to come back to amp , health , infrastructure .
that 's going , but you have to make a little bit of a piece of time .
that means that it means more or less , in all the way that you can worked around is , we can be quite hard , we can actually be able to ask the right products , services , and what we do , how do we do this
what is we going to do and do n't we need ?
the right policy is willing to have the ones that have all the ones .
some evidence have given me .
and at all of the time , science are still going to the way of the whole percent , are still going to be able to get this way , how can we fail to fill this growth ?
but unfortunately , nobody has no longer job .
if you look at the key to the development , the development is what it 's looking at for the last 20 years , because it 's all over the bottom .
politics do n't make the rule and the incentive that are not going to make growth , but that 's the question how are we going to go to us , and that 's how we live a good life of that ?
so , pretty soon it 's not that .
perhaps the physics of the physics you go to lake lake .
with heart , brain , hand and last at all the time we 're going to need to need the hard time .
thank you .
i 'm a believer with the world game .
and i love this city .
this city has so many stories to tell us .
one of them has happened a few years ago .
and doing some of creative things like this .
and then , these creative things are kind of , i get in the same , something later , and i think about history .
it 's being a deal to do it with the recovery .
this is the fact that this is in the middle of this city , and a lot of that city is also , and in fact , in the city .
another story before .
it was a hot summer summer summer in florida , vietnam .
a man that is going on at his shoes as well that it 's right to it .
that 's warm to him .
he 's an private designer , he does n't know that as with the heat .
he 's like , he takes a drop from the ground , a knife at the ground , and it 's going to get there many holes in there .
he goes to the library again , he 's a bit away , and he 's aware he has a new climate climate .
it 's the water that 's hard to be born .
and those number , you see here , you see here in the audience of the rainforest industry , there 's the place today .
a company is actually built , with four letters .
and one of you know it .
he even made the original idea even made of the original idea , and they were offered it .
both have been torn up .
so he 's like , well , i do my own business .
now he goes to the stock market .
now today , several thousand employees in a single thousand business in a world 's world 's world .
so much , this is how creative creative technologies .
why not to invent anything else ?
and they have gotten the question that maybe you have the question of being cut with the mind .
if you do n't know anything else , it 's a chance ?
and that 's the question i 've been doing , many people helped me , in difficult situations .
if something is wrong , or my neighbor 's car does n't work for me or technology , or whatever .
go to , little memory , right .
what 's a opportunity ?
and you 've come from the eye .
so what do i do with the end of me , with this example .
and another example was raised by the wild world , which is the online show .
and the debate , as creative people can be , when it comes to their own insurance .
i want to show you a few examples .
so these are actually this kind of thing on the wild world , and it made it out of the main one .
i love the fantastic thing .
my son has not not to get the woman .
it 's just the game ; there 's the woman 's present by the eye .
or i had been able to work all day in plants when i was put out the lines , i grew up in a bush in my favorite , and i could n't see the other car .
clearly who is going to be , right ?
the bush .
they are the ones are the ones .
i have been a trick , and i 've almost died of almost two times .
and so , you can see , at least , the eye is cooking half the time .
the last thing i did was not to be up at the crash .
and so , the young woman was in the interview .
if you 're a man , any other explanation more powerful than .
but if you are a woman , you do n't understand it anyway .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i 'm hoping to tell me that we all use the value of this creativity .
many of us are now at a online game .
and that does n't be that way .
why not just make any things differently ?
old things that we have become the deal that might have been a way to make us get a way to do the opposite .
why not just do anything different , that 's the time , as a little simple game .
and there 's so much of the companies that use this .
for example , who have been the eye from their street , and this eye or the wall of the wall for example , and there might be something on the wall of it .
a possibility , right ?
and the coffee for the stick of being rather than to the game .
or something like that .
we do n't have any training lanes , let you go .
is it a script , right ?
if you do n't have a phone out of a little bit .
or food they are at me , otherwise we 're clapping out of them .
rm , but creative .
that 's what it takes .
i call it a customer or a scientist that i would then would be to shake and say , okay , i like .
i do the eye with this .
a german trick in which is going to go through the current genome , which is in the end of the time .
so , the sports , again , the most important one , the policy once .
if you were on the 1990s , you have the gold three , you 're in the top of it .
once was that the most had been long at food .
it 's a game building and the restaurant of a very small thing , so the way they 're doing was to do all the hands .
it was too close to too .
they 've got those together , together , what do we do ?
how do we solve this problem ?
we ca n't get faster faster faster .
so , here 's a idea here is actually built .
in every table , there 's fresh and a way of getting a way of making a collective , and it 's called a sense of volunteers , called the end of the eye .
so , the tumor in the game party has eat food as you could have a while .
just different .
an creative idea , and maybe we 've solved it with the eye .
there 's one person who does n't think of a moment .
now , you have this person 's the leader of the eye , so the presence of the eye .
and then we 're doing the german best for them .
the second day , this takes out in the same day , four days of days .
a company has chosen their employees to the staff of the month , and they 'll be able to check that .
rather online , rather , we thank you .
the people come up to us in some ancient eye .
the fluid are full , it 's been done by the people , and of course , of course , every one of the things that you 're looking for others to get to b .
but why not even do some use of a use of a while of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit ?
sometimes creativity happens to be creativity .
and it 's coming from a eye perhaps how the company might be familiar to .
so we 've known to be a lot of good things that it 's not really good , but it 's not going to save with the eye , but it 's a little bit more than saving the time .
or you 're in the car .
we can see that different things , you know , and all kinds of stuff are , you know .
yes .
why does n't you exist in the car if you 're there ?
or now , there are opportunities to do creative of design .
and all of that is just a humor , with joy , with sometimes , is it really stupid , is it , you know , to have rocks ?
sometimes it 's funny .
i had a look at my mind my mind was in the office .
and it 's in the eye here .
so , we have a couple of people around the interview .
and then he turns from left to right , he 's been laughing , and i 'm able to tell you `` i in my favorite part of what you 're telling , '' which is not yet .
he looks like i look at the big eyes , but i see it , the big playground .
and i actually , at the end of that , i 'm right , he 's right , right ?
why is n't that no playground ?
why is this what we do , do n't we do the playground for adults ?
so the one thing is a lot of more useful , right ?
if we 're in the process of being able to use our talents , that do what we like to do .
and with that with the high deal , the equipment is , right ?
the main thing is that if a particular day of what you 're looking at is what 's changing in our brain .
it 's the first day in a week and somehow , our focus is on a different day .
so another day we 'd rather have , mostly .
this is how they 're going to be in night .
and you are the sound you 're hearing in the media .
and the minister of the minister , yes , is it still has another day to the weekend .
or if it gets oil 's time is being oil , the bamboo card , the bamboo box .
what are the rest of weeks of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
do we all have that terrible ?
a trick was on the front page of the front page .
yes , i and i , you know , the rest of your life can do you guys , you know .
or you go to facebook , on facebook , all over the social networks is being a bit .
once me , i was looking at the eye , one of the eye in the eye .
i want to have a lot of business and i love to look at it .
what have the way that have the way that we have in the eye , what is there ?
and one day i 've got a little bit of this business of this character i 'm buying .
and the first sign you see here is , yeah , that 's a very nice thing .
so from that love do you make rather love .
i do n't know , i do n't know , i 'm going to be a father from five kids , but i 've also been my work now .
yes .
or long practice is the most western sign .
why is the ultimate attitude that has a degree of common and more and more and kept on .
and someone even here was that as an answer , it 's not the mountain ; it 's your jobs .
and i actually wonder with the pink harvest , here , and i say , okay , are just doing it all the time .
what 's beautiful at my job ?
that 's stupid , even if it 's the pink dots , it looks everything before .
so something beautiful that is n't beautiful , does n't seem it to work .
the pink use , by the way , is great to the bike .
it 's a wonderful beautiful flying flying which otherwise would be on in the eye .
but not to do the sound to do it .
where is we going to change this when we 're going to change it ?
actually , the content , the content , are our minds ?
within the company , outside as a more older .
it may be a system where we look at the same system as the mouse .
the mouse goes in this wheel and running and running and running , and eventually it will go fast , that wheel , the poor of the poor , the poor goes out and she gets out .
what is the mouse does ?
you know , you do n't know anything else , you 're going to be back to the eye .
and again , maybe the movie 's film , you may know the eye , you may know what 's been known from what you would have heard of .
so this is beautiful to be enough , so she 's doing it , and it 's all right and so again .
and what we feel is , the mouse is once , you know , is once even that mouse at the mouse at time , right ?
or it does it need to make that that make you go out .
i went to this many years ago , so i was on the way i was going home after i was home .
and at once , the street turned out , i felt was quite black in my eyes and i kind of got to stay on my eyes , and i 'm going to stay on a black way .
the next day i went to my doctor , because i thought what 's going to go ?
he was talking to me and said , well , i do n't know , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really ,
but how do it look like that ?
and i looked in my calendar to test that and saw , i worked three weeks of and somehow i loved the job .
after 20 years , in the interview and participants , which are already in the early questions , whether we were going to get at night in the evening .
i thought , what 's really happening in the way ?
and we started to get to the interview that other priorities , look at me with my family 's time , something good for me .
so , if you have n't got other people 's other , give them in my job , a new amount of a computer is .
i realized that talks about great groups doing me really joy .
i do , looking at me , steve and so forth and other things , do other things , but you can pick up to the ted level of experiences , as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well
and that was not always the way .
i have a lot of myself in myself that this is a deep deep power .
and sometimes we need this shot , so the first of the first things that the first is when i was going to leave it to the hospital , i have been brought up by the way he had been met by the hospital after he had a heart
in the past , when i said , you go to a vacuum , he always end me , yes , you walk with your walk and stuff .
now he goes .
so , with the eye , beautiful slowly , but at some point we 're going to go through the right way .
what happens ?
in the bottom of the web , we 're going to be able to get a healthier supply .
the ones go down , but a curve , the courage , the conditions of mental health .
a number of toxic percent in the electricity rate last 10 years , at almost a almost risk rate , the other that 's beautiful .
rise of the mental diseases plus is a thousand percent .
that 's something i think , has this ?
why is that ?
is that just a stronger times like this ?
no , also in germany , it 's like that .
so you go to the moon literature , it 's going to be possible .
that 's the way you can see on the left .
so , in the bottom , that are incredibly powerful and a hundred percent within the last 10 years , a great german will get out of a eye .
the number of safety channels use .
it 's also the cost .
and it 's going to think about different kinds of psychology , what can we do with this subject ?
sometimes you do n't know the way you have an individual game like that , like an example .
so good , it 's meant .
and somebody once said no , no , no , no solution .
but what is the solution to ?
what is the story about doing again and do n't it better and to joy ?
and that has me think about the last few years .
i think there 's something like that , i think , can you even have this ?
i 'm doing this , i 'm not a job , the job is n't going to open and happy .
there are many other things that are important , and are family , health , faith and so forth .
but the fact is that we spend the most part of our eye in work .
and if we do that , why not so do it is a joy to it , and it 's also the other .
i 'll be able to do that with you a second , i 'll offer a second one at the last one , and to get to the interview .
these little little pieces of things that you feel like to realize .
so for energy , freedom of environment and environment .
that means how do i go to my fortune ?
what 's the way i can do in the environment , too with whom ?
what 's the freedom i can here do that , what do i want to do ?
because the kind of things that 's close with .
the more of them , the more stress .
so , what do i do it ?
the main effort .
for that , these four areas are these four areas .
and it can also check it for yourself .
i had to start looking at myself some years ago , and i do n't go back to the feeling .
can i use my fortune ?
in what the environment are you ?
and that means , sometimes i 'm going to go into my laptop , and i can actually change the organized code ,
you have the freedom .
what 's important about the freedom of things that 's important to me .
do i do it ?
the main effort .
the last restaurant restaurant .
and then we have people who explain why this is not all .
and why is a lot harder to show you .
i 'd like to talk about an answer in the spot .
who wants to find a way that 's a way of doing it .
who do n't , i do n't know anything .
and in fact , you can choose to choose a way of making a way of making a way , a way of making a way of making it , or what i 'm doing ?
and they 're going to have the right in both .
so what do we do with our memes ?
now , each of you have noticed its great trick .
it 's also a lot to small .
it 's filled with a bridge game , gold with all kinds , with your skills .
what are we going to do ?
so , by the way , by the way , we 're going to be asking this .
or if we 're in the hospital , or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my goals ?
by the way , who 's really connected here to be able to get here more , by the way .
so , we 're doing it with our perception , so my first question is , as well , in my own myself , every day .
do i really have enough ?
and resources is resources .
but there was something else with a story .
i wanted to tell you about the end of the eye .
and i still call that the game at the right .
this is the air that 's saving on the presence than some over some adult , i came to the enemies .
and the enemies that the cybercriminals realized was good built that she could n't take them .
so , low walls , ways to the presence of the organization , the thick doors of the amazon is the amazon , awful bear .
was so with the back .
so the point of thought , okay if we do n't , we form we 're going to form a eye .
we do n't let it out anymore and we do n't get in .
so , how long call you fall .
the eye was coming from long until long to the big . the big deal .
they 've been still a saying at the way that was happening for the way to be able to be able to be able to the election store at the eye at the end of the body , give me the interview and give me three days .
plastic right , the game , you 're in touch , come to you , come , take the ones and help us .
so i do with the eye .
at the bottom of the body , the enemies like the wall of the food , the food led to the food , is led to the left , and then it 's early at the early days .
well , think of what is already already .
it 's just me .
again , a game gets on the wall of the vagina , and this is it 's black .
and i think , oh , oh , two of you think , two are the two you , you can take it something .
at the evening , the same scenario still had before , this one , is the time , is the time that 's the time to go on and off .
at the end of the second day , after the six different ones , they 've gone down down at the bottom of the bottom , they 're going to a trick .
because they thought that they 'll take too long , we do n't think their self 's still .
and then the eyes went down to the interview and the interview .
you had one that you had , and you 'd be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the computer room .
and there are the online interview that are out of it .
i like this idea that everything is going on , and we have everything that we need .
sometimes , it 's more important resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's not .
but also , we can do something about it .
we have no idea about what we 've been doing in our world every day .
and if you think that could be good to you , you have right .
the spring comes from the spring .
that 's what happens .
and we walk in high knowledge , there 's the snow camera there that is there 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
there are been estimated in some of the things that these are the new engineers .
and there are you here are a very popular thing that we harvest and eat food .
there is a quarter of this grain , and then we can make it more and make bread bread .
there are any animals that eat the food .
there 's people that then do the products that i just eat from that later .
and it comes up .
but if you think that , maybe that , you may n't automatically , that 's what happens to be anything that is to fear and reduce a fear .
and of course , a threat is probably very abstract , and very facts , but in the way , but in the way , but in the way the carbon sector , the connection of the cost of the plant , bees are very , very , very
there are research that shows that up to the percent of our food , we ca n't use it if we had no bees .
and also , that sounds like this is normal for us , and we do n't get bees that perhaps .
there 's now some time now in a very interesting film , the theme of a time .
and i feel you look at it .
now , we 're going on the gentleman 's gentleman to be working on bees , and in high school , in the end of bees .
and that 's what he 's doing here at a school , and he 's going to tell a few work now about his work .
please , please .
yes , good evening .
only one of the things that you 're doing with mr. people is to go and the end of that .
that i am here with my project , today , or you can make some different , and you can make a different way about the life of the bees .
and that also , under a way , a trick to a trick little eye , that 's fun .
because i think that the main thing i can suppose that the most important one of you are willing to be a while of the end of the company , it would be a game company , and in fact , to be able to be able to be
i do n't stop that , no .
but maybe what else might have me , they 're trying to get this to love with this eye or some of you to develop and to engage them for this eye , the very eye of the brain .
my name is thomas , thomas , with an amazing woman , father 's father 's not a father , and i have a lot of the skills and the computer rate , and i 've been left for the presence of the eye and adults .
i 'm a member of the eye and be the community of care of the online eye .
and now , at the interaction , we 're now at the eye at the eye , at our own one of the oldest students .
we 're working there in the garden and in agriculture and in in the game in play .
so , in terms , a play of the eye is the game and is the kind of eye force .
our flying classroom is actually more an killer , a silence , a quiet thing .
and she also leads for her as she was .
it 's almost a trick issue .
and not for the old state of the world 's connection between honey , so the trick is actually the trick .
and in a wonderful sample of atoms , he describes his hands on the `` the '' '' like the `` she 's trying to inspire him that he can come back again .
but it 's not a bit at all of the way to go out , but you 're going to do it with some of the blue bees and you now go to you the house with electricity and drive into your mouth in your mouth , and then
a beautiful picture .
hopefully me , i hope , i 'll go back to the evening .
yes .
flying classrooms .
i come to the project .
one of these eye , which is where my students have built me together , and i 've come to a eye days to a eye days .
in the 1950s schools , of us in the school school , or in the presence of the eye or to get the eye schools .
you 're going to go to the eye , or in the classrooms where to be in the end of us .
the teacher , who is , i 'm running this project with me and look at a stage a bomb place for that kind of eye .
mostly , the windows can see something to the children as well .
and all of things ago the bees that then inside the sea and then they can put through the board and again .
and then you created the window at the window a company .
that 's how it .
and then all of me start with me on the eye .
so i 'm going to be able to be able to go and talk , and i 'm going to do out of the lead side tool , two eye , and i 'm going to do it in this place here .
and this is important on this eye on this game , so solar bees are bees .
also , we 're going to be a game here , and now have to be able to be a whole deep way of being fresh eggs .
and then , in a turn , up here .
there 's your honey inside .
you need to do bad weather if you need bad weather , and you ca n't fly .
that 's how it .
this is what it looks like .
then the eye comes back to this end , immediately starts in this that 's the online places , or in the school for place .
and now , it starts a wonderful thing .
ladies and gentlemen in that point in the class , i suddenly experience in a crisis .
your people is no longer .
they are lonely .
they 're not finding their queen .
and that 's the most important thing that when he thinks that he 's a given up that the queen in the old people are .
so , that 's not what these two eye is sitting .
and they 're going to be sad , these bees .
they start to beat their own .
yes , it says they 're in darfur .
you hear that .
you 're almost a trick for the end of almost if you 're in your eye with a queen with a queen with your eye .
and now we start a trick .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , they now will be able to do the need to create a new people without doing it without the ones without any longer , who are n't a single ones , and they 're not
here 's the people coming , and then it 's then , then , then the first night in the first night .
without any example , there were no queen people out of the people after six weeks .
because they 're just doing six weeks .
that 's how it .
and in that first night , you get a pencil out a pen out there 's a pencil and bring it into that into the eye .
and there 's a way of `` we 're supposed to have been queen , ''
anybody who 's been at high school are saying , `` how do you go ?
yes , we 're all so different to get to get out of the eye .
that 's true .
and now , it starts a wonderful thing .
this thing which here is usually become a more rural game , and that would be a queen 's a queen .
the team has the first three days as the women on the atmosphere .
and it 's been invented in the front of a eye .
you know this term .
and immediately , it changes in this view of genetic code .
the ones are changing changing through the food themselves in the eye .
we already heard that the moment before we eat food .
and the queen is that really wonderful .
so three days , and five days now , there are five days .
and they can lose their students .
and see you see this in education .
and then this cell becomes going to bring into it with a piece of piece , and that 's not happening all the way , because the people now are now social choices , or because of a eye , is that , in the age of a sense
no , this is what happened .
ladies and gentlemen , is a trick or a eye .
and then the student and the students , every student every student , white three and a queen , '' and so close for me that these queen are in the trees .
and on the day , if that 's the teacher , the teacher has been writing in the city of the city in the city at the city at the city at the city at the city at the city morning .
and then the mother , i say , tell you , what 's these ?
yeah , i have to go in school .
yeah , why ?
yes , our queen 's muslim .
yeah ?
and then the morning at the school are at high school .
and then , the presence of the street and then , the presence of the eye , is because they want to be able to be able to grow up .
and if you really get this , you 'll hear something first .
these are my name paradox .
that 's how it .
it 's still a little higher .
and then they come and then come up and open these queen free .
the first thing that 's this queen , they 're killing their wings and they 're now with this one in their eye with what their own the queen was turned out , their smell , their
the people have a identity .
now , three to the three , five days long , this queen are made for five days .
from the eye in front you get your eyes away .
and back the way that 's going out from the back of the people , from this spot .
and after five days , these queen were gone to the eye .
now , some of think , yes , i 've seen this kind of eye there ,
hold , listen .
we completely know of other .
let 's let us let that .
now this queen i actually moved around with me , without the way , with any of the time , from this interview , from the eye , up to two miles up .
you certainly have seen seen before your apartment .
in the interview , there 's a more simple eye there , from seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the other way around islam where man can have different women , here 's the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and the whole thing happens in a wonderful way in the flight .
the drone comes from the back of the back , and this queen 's from the very queen , now , is now what it 's going to do is they need to take seeds to get three years for eggs .
it 's also an amazing experience for the drone .
if you finished , you die , you know , you die , you die , you die , and you see it falls dead from the sky .
and then the queen comes back and starts to put eggs .
there 's always one , two students in the class that would immediately see that immediately .
and you also see that look at the queen 's , right now .
yes .
and then the project in school is then , because the voice has become the eye , and the queen and the women will now be in that level of that .
and then one night i then come from here before .
so you go to the front of the outside , and you 're talking to the next morning , i 'm standing with the queen with the queen with me with the queen .
and you see here , the queen 's going to .
yes .
elena do .
you know , there 's 10 to 12 .
and then these are come , these two eyes are coming up here .
a full stick , in a particular stick , and now this people can be big and powerful .
why are bees living in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , children who have experienced that , they never forget that anymore .
yes .
there is n't just so much that the students then are going to be together all the time , but the whole school comes out into this class .
and the teacher , if he can know something , if he can do , if he 's prepared a time he can be prepared to the other price .
look , bees and despair have been even at the years that people have already have their honey illness .
a few months ago , you 've found this in israel 's , and you find some famous years old contact in the time that people were given the bees .
any human culture has with bees .
or the other way the other way that bees were in every culture .
in china , in india , in egypt , in east rome .
they were all of the time .
the human cultures are ladies and gentlemen , are fast .
he can get a trick , a trick , he can make a game .
ladies and gentlemen , you know , is some flowers or trees to make the bees you need ?
you know , find something like that , now you now find in the summer of agriculture .
this is that , this is a green desert to our bees .
yeah ?
he can go to the school students go in the factory and there are flowers plants in the factory there , at the way they 're going to open and look at how long they need to go from the interview up to my flowers ?
how long are you going to be on the individual sector ?
and how long do you take them back until long to them .
he can have been a word of a word .
so how do i have a ticket ?
yes .
you know , if that 's like , that in the end of that , the tip is a place , or were just dead you up ?
look at exactly exactly .
he can be a mathematics -- a game .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , it 's even the time in students , the presence of the students .
and then he comes to the question , how could that jefferson get the prize at the prize ?
because he taught the bees see this in the bridge .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a study , in the valley , is present .
there 's nothing like that , there 's nothing .
and only the professor who taught many years taught in the university , has taught the bees to create the bees there , are going to the online end .
like a eye of the higgs web of the electricity , to make a eye , and now with the open and with the open and now , with the open with a broken team of their eye , and the bees , the ones , the ones that
see what these bees do in school ?
it 's like small times like the boxes , and the children lose their fear in the bees .
and then create a awareness of care for the bees .
they 're learning , the ones , look at what the bees are doing .
and you get some of these creatures that basically only make people humans .
the bees are creating a tree per healthy group , and the bees are not even a carbon increase in a year .
now , years ago , we had the only way to make sure we create .
you guys accumulate the force outside the trees , the eye at the trees .
this is a trick , and you can get the device , you know , your people out .
and now imagine in the summer , which is a wild -- you 're going to be sold , and you 're going to do bees in this room , with a degree .
hey , there 's no meme involved without the end .
no , the bees do n't .
because they have natural antibiotics in this eye .
they collect the pollen , and it shows they 're getting it , will be able to do a professional trick .
someone who 's about the eye is , `` hey , '' at the possible time , you can go to you today , and you can turn a eye by having the eye out of the people from the people .
of course , a grid of mine and with a interview and so on , there 's nothing .
yes , and then they 're so much and they were the chief of the public , the bees , and of course , the bees , and we would have less solar , if the chinese would not fly , or we would have to be like the
there are a lot more around .
look at the eye , because there 's the legacy of the body , the growing growing up on the amazon , where the cows stops .
and there is the bee there , it 's going to be a ridiculous and more extraordinary one that will get that to the end .
and now the cow comes to the eye and only , because they 're going to go to go to you go to you , you can go and see , you can see .
yeah ?
and they 're going to realize that again and realize , ah , i have a trick , ah , i can get there .
and then there 's milk .
it makes the bee makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to the very good , the bee is the bee of what it is on the nature .
so , the honey .
i want to come a little bit on the point .
my students are looking at every year , and i think , to make these eye , and they sort of like to go together with me .
now , this does n't take my eye to me , but i 've had my eye student , and i said in the college school and i said , you know , `` well , you put you out ,
and then he says , yes , i 've hot you .
i come from eye with the eye , and i 'm six years .
and i 've been in the five years since i 've been in the morning , and i 've been in the thomas for two years .
and i 'm happy , i 'm happy to me , i do n't have to learn to learn to the presence of the eye , but to learn with your hands .
so you go with your head .
and a trick went through the eye , and the school college college .
and more than half , oh yeah , we want to .
my students experience a tremendous white molecule , and the speed of time , normal and more and more and the third of people leave the bees .
and on the way , you 're going to go out and you get out of it , my students and a certain student .
how can you fix it ?
the question is wrong .
you 'd be to say , how do you go to the interview ?
and i think that it 's the person that 's being in , it 's the other people to go and give him a new eye program .
and he says , `` step with this .
so , at the end of a end of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye .
who the sun would be the sun to feel the sun 's way through the eye that would never get the way to the ground and never lose the fields the fields that the fields in the game , like it 's also a little bit cry .
thank you .
hi , love , love in the world .
welcome to my presentation .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the struggle for a end of female selection .
in my eyes , the largest crime of humanity , because it 's made for me for a few years .
the society against the women are still found even even and even six more ever .
first of all , i 'd like to introduce you up .
my name is right , i 'm coming from a desert .
i 've done it for years to run a stick .
you can think that my job has n't come up .
i felt not to get me .
and i was happy , i was in the theme of all with good amounts and exciting practice .
for example , this .
there 's massive at the atlantic with the atlantic coast of africa .
on the practice , a stick to the presence of california , the one of the time in the most of american people at the last century american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american american
this was a turn where i was more at the time , the one thing to make it be more at it .
and yet , that practice were a given , the interest of the media , was to find a small person , like me , to me in the world 's little the language .
so i 'm going to do with a oil designer that 's going to be in ethiopia .
there was this there between war and ethiopia and there were that that 's there and that memory there .
and despite all the wikipedia we were , we were on the other side of the eye , the collective samples of the eye that we needed to do is to have arab , arab , arab
and twice it were that we were being used to the fact that our two ways they see here , they see that with their bodies as a living nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear services , and they said that the tumor is my
if you want to kill the ones , you 're going to shoot a little bit through a way .
i found that `` i found a person in some other culture .
and then , in that time , in a young years , you 've learned of islam , you can not reduce islam at terrorism .
and they do n't want to reduce some of those , they 're not going to reduce on their own terrorism .
for example , for example .
the bee , the game .
it would be rather for the true values like love , social responsibility , the ones that are the ones that are in the eye .
these are the values that it 's worth for being being worth struggle .
so for many years , i 've been in this trick , working with my wife .
and then we heard from this with female selection .
and when i heard that the whole percent of the everyday people who would do , the rest are christians and are , `` are i thinking about how islam does n't have the eye in the shoes ?
and the idea was to bring the highest quality of islam to explain the practice to protect them .
we were looking at india at the state we were in german organizations , we did n't find .
we 'd let us hear that we 'd be completely at now right now , islam did n't go well .
you 'd like the gun camp .
so on the presence of visual international , we started to be able to set our own organization .
and were out of the eye , by the end of the eye .
and so now , we also need to win in the fight now , we needed images .
this is a lack of being .
and so i went to this desert , and i put them pictures with the other camera , and i 've got these images .
the bad depth pictures i do n't show you , but i want to put a minute the crime .
and in the age of four weeks , at the military , eventually , from their parents and family , the earth is actually created on the earth , and where they sit down with the water and look at them with the end of the dog and the
what 's a company you 've left is a company from the size of the size of the eye .
so , the second is now going to take a decade .
if you get your rule , they 're actually using two weeks .
it 's an body and soul , control .
that was the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning .
in the meantime , we continue to continue on .
the man has to open it to .
he never saw a while he saw a while , at a while , he was never seen .
the grain have said it was , oh , to stop , is n't a problem .
you make your dogs out of it , and then you get the hard thing .
and if you ca n't get it , it 's not bad .
you take the knife and you 're going to get them up .
that 's the trick .
there was a third of the girl around this .
you 'd come to a three months ago .
before i was lost by the girl , the girl lost his own language .
these are the ones , also some in asia .
most of them are a profound weapon .
and when we asked muslims , why do n't you do that ?
the answer is , it 's got to do the game , that 's what you have to do , that 's in the koran .
nothing on the koran , quite in the opposite .
every school game at five days every day , like 400 times , the creator , is , is perfect , the game .
but they seem n't to believe what to pray .
they provide the women who has created false women wrong , which you could be as powerful as being human , in the other of women .
but now we had the images to the first percent of the world 's first , this secret thing .
he gives us a whole whole way to a conference is to turn out .
there were heavy surgery , two days long .
but we had the dawn on the board of our site , the highest eye on our side .
and then the great decision came , the practice is against all of human rights , against religion , we have to miss it .
when the way the way in the way , the way we have the way , is this new eye in the way .
and when you know africa and you know , you know , it 's just true for these people .
and it was fantastic , and those of those successes , we got in other countries too .
so , you still have , you know , you 're going to be a bit of the best principles , the presence of the country that is , you have a crime to write inside the country , and now , to get it into the presence .
we were just working on the road , with a personal rock .
that 's a hundred , you have it .
and where we came and where we have open ears , open arms and most vulnerable , holy obama .
and when we wanted to leave the country at some time , the big round of applause and go to you want to be able to have all the online countries now ?
that 's how much life you will not be in there .
he 's right .
i 'm a believer , and you have to slow slowly to this .
and he had an idea .
he said , if you 're able to bring into you to study the ten eye to study the world to the table , and you need to write the practice to your own , it 's a guy .
so , to make me into some of the eye and get , and you get the flow of a loop of the middle .
and with the time for the game for the eye , his eyes will be able to make his own professor of an eye on the morning .
he stopped a idea of the idea was a funny thing , especially when we beat him that would be .
and we 're doing about some of the things that are support to us .
and then he said , `` i 'm not just going to make the conference , '' and how we asked it , but i will take the eye .
and that 's what he did .
over microsoft 's result of our actions , our environmental act of communication .
international security systems are going to the face of the female body of the female .
and below the game in the end of professor , there are an given place .
and everybody 's got it .
a hundred of the interests , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of the presence of food , the man has a voice in a square desert and in the rest of europe , he 's the most basic trick for cartoons .
so , men who can be living and death .
but also the other .
on the left of the eye , the right is the right , the trick .
the highest world in the world .
so i think about it only to me , i think , in my way , i 'm going to do an vacuum and i personally to do an interactive personal .
and then i 've all a break .
it started the conference .
and among our sign , the end is from egypt .
the eye with the eye , the presence of the name is to go through the time , germany .
so much about this , islam is not to do it .
we also had the study of the way that we still do before the way that they were going to bring women in there with the eye .
and then in the front of the movie , there 's no way about that .
reality .
the men had clean eyes .
they were going to have written off the doors behind the street after only two hours to be written and wrote a design of a piece of eye .
the trick are coming out of the cameras , including whatever you had to do .
and the most important sentence in this , that was this .
female ambiguity is a crime crime for the highest values of islam .
he named the bird 's seat .
we thought the job was n't done without the call without our physiology .
because the ones who are talking about the job of the woman , is far more than any minds .
that 's why we have a game game .
we 've got this conference in this so-called `` golden golden book .
a trick for the world of the world .
and because in least , the game found so well , the book , he 's found it through a body .
it 's going to drive us out of your hands .
we had had a lot of countries to play the bomb with the entire range of each other .
and they read this with interest some of the people that they will put the book .
but unfortunately , most of the most powerful system did n't have the courage to go to now .
you ca n't talk about the chest growth on the food chain .
just some people noticed the courage .
they went down to the universities , they 're on land school .
and sometimes we found some more the more sophisticated lines in fact actually have a way of that as well as the u.s. is like here .
and then it goes through the eye .
and that 's the numbers that are .
they will spread it .
but i 'm going to run the time .
it 's all of the hot tissue to hot tissue , and that 's what i work on many other strategy , the subject still get this topic .
practice practice .
but i do n't mean that would be .
i want to share the great message of the highest range of the world , and that is what islam is called the presence of the loss .
not so much to get out , but in the end of the eye .
if there are four million people together together , men and women are in the islamic part .
and i then , i 'm standing with all of these and the former king of king , the driver 's up with the forest test .
i 've got this in the time i 've got in the front time .
unfortunately , the last one is the most me , which would be the mind king of king .
but i 'm sure when he would show it .
one is about how to help women .
to another , in the world , to show the true true islam , instead of all over the world 's point more time .
you get a eye of terrorists .
if i do n't , i do n't know what , you know , what i had in a square time .
that 's at least many and many of the grain of the world in the world in the world .
and we could be able to click on there .
and maybe i still tend to think that little girl needs to be more at autism .
then my life has really , right ?
and i want to be the word of everybody that i 'm heard of , right , to do it , to be able to do that .
and i have n't going to get away at a game game .
we have to get the need in the distance , otherwise i still have this one of this stage .
and now i 'd like to tell you the design of my eye already now .
that 's my eye , my eye game .
and this is in all the world 's five weeks , in the name of the eye and to prevent it , it has to happen to me that .
we have it in the bottom here , and we also have it in german .
female ambiguity with the koran , with the koran and the desire of islam .
it 's right , and a smooth and a clean , of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i go out with this .
this is the eye in which i was going to be a break in germany .
and you have the game 's saying , my mom , my brother and i first have a little vision as a chocolate .
it was the game at it .
my mother was totally depressed because she did n't understand why we 've given you now now now now now .
on the third day we were finally driving .
we were standing in the third way that the stuff would take away to this again , then the one thing was a trick and sent it up and just turn out this with the eye .
she tried to explain to us , we could be eating .
that 's not what we call ,
it even tastes very well .
it 's an cheese cheese .
my mother moved up and we laugh .
cheese .
in my country , we have a puzzle , but it would n't smell that .
i 'm a believer , and i 'm doing it old .
i was going to talk about four years ago i am with my mother and my brother from china to germany .
so i 'm telling you today .
but most importantly , it 's about me to make people make these sentences and made to a success success success .
but first , i 'm going to you , where i 'm in a piece of view .
i 'm a believer .
it 's a little business game that lives in the middle of china .
and this region is called the chinese area at the chinese .
it 's about 12 from germany away .
in china , in china , 10 million communities , but in fact , the biggest will community is the most popular community .
and so therefore that they have to be in here because we need to suffer in china under the molecular human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human
hundreds of chinese were sending extra to be able to get with that , so we have become a successful on that our own home .
our own friends , their own , was moved from the system of education .
in schools , in universities , chinese will be used .
and our religion , we do n't have to be free free .
the results are losing their culture and identity .
and then , if someone 's been a little , if someone 's a little , and for the same way of the same , they provide a lot of the religious , or death , or even death .
and that was also why my parents have decided to recover with us children .
that was the end and i was 11 years old at the time .
and then the picture came out of the dry ,
we did n't have enough money , so my dad had to leave me behind .
i get a lot of people who helped us really run on the recovery .
i do the whole lot of many images .
but i do n't go to the online end of view .
i would look at him right in the same way when i 'm doing my eyes .
he was a big job system , and we 're going , and we 've got a little bit of him and made him with his little street around the parking room .
the first rate was being brought up .
i know a lot of a negative image of the eye have that the only business wants to make business and have n't interested for the whole quality of care .
but i would say , i 'd be calling him as a game game , not like a game game .
because it was a duck that was sent to us guys .
he stood at the airport airport in a interview , and to the last end of the end , is the really safe way we 've got to come through the eye .
in fact , in the end of the mind , we came there and i 'll be able to tell me what my mother was like , was out from the airport , and i 'll tell you out of the airport .
do n't matter .
until we are outside .
because i had a look at the eye in my hand , and there was my photo there , and there was an alien name , and i had a social name in there .
i had to go to the eye .
and i get to the interview at the eye , and he had the little pieces of my eye in hand .
silence .
thu-huong ha .
a long thing .
finally , we were finally at the face .
in fact , i 've got many , many , many , i have a lot of food that somehow had to have been .
i do the woman who used to be used to us with the end of us .
in a eye , with four at a time , per capita families .
at least high children .
you have a step and a kitchen .
there was some other faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mom , my brother , and i had to share a trick .
there are a lot of homework , you know , homework and homework made his homework .
friends do n't come to visit me because i used to be where we used .
but just my favorite eye is at the economy at the economy .
she knew my story and she was very , and she was scared to me .
for example , she brought me to meet what i do n't do now .
but she also did somehow meet a way of having a way of having a few years of meeting me .
i spent my whole kitchen classes in the interview .
that was not easy to my mom 's simple .
and i always with you with with us with your husband and in the process we 've been only a string , and you could be treated at any time .
i do n't get that i was very , very aggressive , at the time .
i 'm also a little bit embarrassing now , which is now going to tell you about this , but now i have just got to stand to my story .
i was very pleased and could somehow focus on the school in school .
so , we 've got to first have a lot of open to open to open children ,
i 'm normal with the normal one , i mean , kids who had to be in a eye with you .
i have to be able to do with me , and i 'm going to get my brother to get and sent out to you or sent up with you a while .
it 's just a little bit of us .
i also made me made the way we made that crime because our parents were n't able to do a german .
or , they just do n't stop with us .
and we 've always been a little bit very well .
i know how we were always sitting on the board and we were thinking about these people , because , somehow people , people had time for us , and that was important to us .
after two years , my father came to germany .
but the problem was that he was in the very eye of the eye , because it has no idea in the eastern community , there 's no place for him .
i do n't get a very , very , very smooth , very smooth , who made it , my father , to keep it in the front of us to keep us even in china , even that he had to live with us in school living .
i am standing at that time where i really know , very happy because after six years , we finally had gotten into a normal home .
we got a design for three years , and we finally had a personal apartment with their own simple and our own kitchen .
and i even had one room .
it was very small , and i do n't have a desk inside , but it was good , i could do these door to do these door .
and i 'm saying i 've had used time , i 'm used , but i had to do even the production end left without just left with the end of my head .
i did n't really see it 's a perspective .
there was a while which would still have been on the end of me , and it still does the idea that i can get the second way i can get the second way i can get my own high school with my latest schools .
first of all , the game is doing the game .
i thank you , i 'm really going to get the teacher who was really at the time i made just made it until the middle population .
and i came to the interview .
and before i came up with the interview , i played with the best friend of the eye ,
so , there 's an organization or a project , or a project to organized .
but i did n't have a good trick i did , because we had a place where we could go to go out .
we had a kind of a kind of a kind of thing that we could do with our economy .
and the head of the eye was somehow trying to tell us our problems , and he 's kind of design us and could design us on all of our questions .
and then i came to the conclusion and i get to see .
and this is a project where young people without the ability to get the possibility to get into the way .
this really did me have done very well , and i realized art is something i do n't do .
by the contact and then , a little place came into us .
he did the film to the movie he made about life from my friends and mine .
and the film won a lot of food prices .
we realized that people was interested in our story .
he was a very feeling feeling because we never had noticed that people would be listening to us .
and that was the moment i thought , okay .
i do n't want to leave it to it anymore anymore .
i want to make something from my life .
a ph.d. of the eye , a trick for b to me to go into a while of the eye from the eye .
but there i was in the late building i went in , i ended up with a eye for the play and the title is at four .
so i was exactly right .
i played with it .
and the great thing is that after one , two degrees of the most ones on me are a lot of time .
and i asked me , i 'd just like to make a way that i could have a way to do a interview .
i thought great , of course , of course .
i 'm sure , yeah , '' i do .
and i made the radio program , and now we make up and one of my favorite pieces of play in the place that i was doing to do with the european eye in the european eye .
and i did n't have him actually .
now i study the school with the interview and film , and film the third time , on the third year , and i 'm a trick to the third time .
and all of this would be n't possible for me if i 'm not a single or young organizations like the ones , like online , like online , you would be used for me for the eye .
they thought about it , they have a lot open , they showed us ways i 'd like to have my place for a society .
and there 's what i come now .
now , each of you have the opportunity to get people to help a chance and find their life or that .
because , the people , the people come up with high a local time , and each of them are full of hope , and every one of them have a huge potential .
they 're with very high school with many terrible waves behind them .
and with that community , they could really be a big profit of germany and also it for every one .
and i could tell a thousand things about what you can do , but i do n't have the idea there , i have n't have enough time there , i have a minute here , i have a game
and i do n't get your phone student , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't use a code with a code .
and compare them a code , and then you come on the side of a lot of people , which you can be limited .
and that would help us quite good .
i 've been friends now for their engagement , and we hope .
and then compare them to the code .
i just got the outside of it .
many people do n't want the phone phone .
are you happy that you become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
marcus is .
first of all , in the very top of grass , was really really an eye .
so i 'm happy to have to get into .
my name is a restaurant name .
my eye is easier to be easier than what is it .
i come from a lot of times , that 's in rome .
i 'm happy to be a very , you can be going to be in a game , and really beautiful here .
i 'm a bit of course , i 'm a little guess here .
and this is not a word , it 's a feeling .
yes , yeah , in terms of the other hand i 'm not here today to talk about anything .
i did n't know what .
it 's so , i write out my own , and then i 'm going to talk about that somewhere , mostly in the game , or you can see , or look at it 's a bit like that today today .
yes , and i was asked to be asked up today , so some of these texts , there 's a little bit of these texts , i did .
and that 's what i 'm going to do now .
yes .
i start looking at a joke .
you 've got two birds .
so , that one , you 're two english force , you 're going to do it with the right with the eye , but you 're doing that very funny , you see , you know , there are very funny to the eye with the eye
i want to say the other thing .
it makes a lot of gps of the word you ca n't do .
so here we have started to be able to go at this level .
the first text is a little game that i wrote in the moment .
i was in one person who has some part of what i 've had .
it 's called the title of the title .
and yeah , she did n't understand that .
as your head in my pocket was my rest of my life under my ceiling .
my leg also was the leg on the ceiling , was outside the ceiling .
my leg was long for the ceiling .
it 's about her head on my lap , and the rest of her her ceiling , my leg , as one of the ceiling , is her leg outside the ceiling .
this has been extremely long as a mine , extremely long .
it was very romantic .
i just had to do the next one at the next time i was going to end up a person who is really really a lot .
and that was the christmas quote .
we did n't have a step in any time .
my online grandfather was a long job .
already as a child , he 's been calling with the western revolution .
it 's just like that .
yeah , in one day , text text .
we 're not going to get those better .
jesus is the only one act on the building on the building on the building .
but where jesus was when he should me go to save that building `` save '' ?
are you thinking , yes ?
i 've made my online business ?
they 're on our daily text .
the next text is a little bit longer .
he actually takes a year to do that .
so writing .
read your reading is faster .
so the start of a novel i write to be a lot in the eye .
ah , it 's going to be a guy , so the old room from a guy who kept left to hair and a little bit of the eye .
i still get to the position of this position , i get away from the place , i hated them .
because i 'd never afford to be a hair color .
chapter one .
if i become the eye become empty .
so as the kind of thing that he now was trying to fill .
yes , i 'm not there .
very hard hours .
now the next text is also a little trick .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm also doing right too hard .
and that 's what i 'm going to do is i love to be your grandmother and language .
i 'd like to be played with me .
and yes , they are coming out out .
it 's called the title of the title .
it 's a little bit very strange , water .
is that you 're actually written by being writing .
it 's a game of the world 's way .
yes , we fail .
all of our way is all .
we 're doing it in the end .
i mean , i have about a diamond man .
but i can .
i could be more longer .
i do n't do .
yeah , i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yeah , yeah , so , forget about me .
i always say , either everyone or no one of no one of no one .
the next one has also been able to do what text text .
it 's kind of a little game trick .
i wrote that at insects .
very strange .
yeah , in one day , text text .
is a little trick .
and the one is really cool when i make so you make your saying that you could say .
my text is wearing the title , all good things are cool .
so , there are dry dry .
we have growing around in cars .
so , you have to get , you go , go up , you know , and you go , and then it will be better and yes , that 's it .
beautiful forms right now .
yes , still in the end of that , that 's another thing .
and in fact , in the last one , i think so i do n't think we could do so we could make any kind of a eye way , so that we all have all the way that we 're doing all of that .
right , so that 's what the wind does .
text : text is the title , and the text is here .
yes .
power fun to you .
the eye text text is simply one sentence .
i love to be a little bit of the way .
this is a mystery dead street duck .
it 's written away with with the food with its mind .
`` practical ? ''
yeah , yeah .
power fun to you .
yeah , even in the ones .
that 's what you wrote .
it 's a long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible to explain in childhood university , that 's the point .
here , another text .
this day is a trick .
is the title of text .
this day , it 's a trick , and he knows it .
he 's already known before i 've been a fan of a word .
he was actually able to look at it in a short day , and then he would go to the end of the interview .
i just can go with him a interview .
i made him the joy .
it was as a while in the front of the other days and went to sleep .
with a more a design book book , where else , in the face of the face ?
and intent , it 's no longer to become involved by having to make it .
and i just went to , i ca n't go , i would n't have to have a stick day .
there 's hope , is n't it ?
it 's now been a little joke now .
what was the einstein 's einstein said , when his foot does n't just liked ?
i 'm interested in .
that 's how it .
man sounds sound like the cow .
that 's why it 's funny .
yes , the next text has learned the paper .
it 's rather , rather , the political .
so i write a funny thing i 'm asking .
i write a very , part of political things .
and i often asked the way i go to .
and , yeah , i just wrote this text here .
he 's wearing the title .
my father came from russia , then in my mother , and i made her .
yes .
we would have had the game with the game .
thank you very much for sound .
yes , i 'd love to do some advertising i 'd like to do a little advertising .
i ca n't go back or so much , so i always have to do that to do this .
and i also call myself , and i also do , even a while , i think , a result of infection in rome .
you can love to come out .
and yeah , i 'm going to be `` you '' i 'll actually have a very mess to me .
and , yeah .
i just want to say that .
it goes on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertising that i wrote .
june .
rich in the c c .
so the game .
vitamin death .
it 's very funny .
i want to write a joke about your friend in the game of your friend , but it was just flat in front of all over .
yeah , is n't a little view .
now , to stop the end of action of stop music with the order to do it , the trick actually saw the eye of it .
yes .
thank you listening .
you 'd expect great .
thank you very much indeed , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start with a right question .
why is you going to take in doing this ?
i think anybody who should use the money to ask whether he 's certain times that society 's going to be taught .
and the answer is clear .
we now know that life life is just about a roughly genetic eye .
it 's kind of any of the body effects , the influence for the game .
why do we still know anything ?
why are we going to take away from the eye of news ?
you all remember four years ago the blood company was found .
it was fat .
and they thought that if you get the fat of the food , we all get up and get healthy old .
and what has happened to do with different interaction in america is led to the different action of america , and what has really become a lot of the americans have been getting low every year .
and then you say , ah , no .
but not the fat is the fat .
it 's the historical sequence .
so what 's going to do is like the eye of the eye that has on the eye and so on .
so again , this could have a new new eye in the village .
how much of the people ?
now the reason is , i 'm interested in the taste of the part of the time that we have been really on to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have
in particular , for example , is here .
the day they all know .
so , a much popular water published a new piece of water water .
the top eye of the eye is about to the point .
nathan hospitals was a seven years for a one one .
then the newspaper was then in the newspaper .
or this lady .
it can be a trick game .
the oldest man who lived the top on earth .
close to age .
i know there are people out there , who said , they 're six times , but they 're not going to do their business right now .
it actually has to be close to be its head .
and she was just heard with the eye at a way , but with the interview again to get to the game , to stop the path of being able to follow and stop stop .
you have died of the eye .
what does this tell us ?
not that exponential healthy .
it says , that was a lot of complicated , that was , and we need to have to have the awful statistics we need simple and simple , simple systems , and we have to ask simple questions .
and we were able to ask simple question , and we had a very simple idea that in various countries , women are older than men are getting in .
what is that ?
we 're now know it now .
so this is where we 're produced on the turn , so in the male .
and there are very simple evidence for that men are going to be like women like women .
now , can we think about yourself , if that 's a online game ,
we 've been trained a joint of the country in austria .
but there 's a better fear coming here . it 's not afraid of fear .
we 're going to get back to the way to escape it with independence .
sounds complicated , but just to stop the normal way .
so , somebody went to join and ask a little bit of these things in tanzania , and they ask , `` what do you have done differently or different that she has become so old ?
ah .
the dragon-king security has been in the world every day , in the world 's 10 day .
so this is probably the secret of your age , right ?
and in fact , the ten species may not be close by themselves .
but they have some times , the power director , without the ten percent are still older .
and even hard statistics are not all kinds of all kinds of all kinds of things .
for example , there were used very hard to be very hard , which shows that people , who are going to go back to the presence of their fish , they 're going to be older than people who do n't do that .
it 's a lot of .
it 's blowing on it .
is that `` right ? ''
no .
it 's because people just have enough money in the pocket to do them from age , they all have the presence of the community .
but if i give a group of data , i 'm going to give you a interview for a food , and this group of data lives 20 percent than just to cover the eye , but otherwise the same thing in thought i 've thought , in fact
and in fact , these are really trying to be done here .
now , have to tell you that the eye is very sensitive , but even i 'm saying to my enemies is that the driver 's spread life .
and that works for all organisms .
for example , i was with bacteria .
you 've got a look at bacteria here .
if we got the courage to line out , then that 's the most obvious longer to the game .
the same thing for the power of mass are flying and recently , recently , recently , has been shown only about two years ago , in the united states , it 's even for the monkeys .
and it 's not about being having to be young .
it also works with the river kitchen .
and that 's another experiment that has been done in the united states .
what 's done here ?
you 've got to go out and get it into the kind of cold you want to be able to make a while you have so many contact here and night .
and who asked , the oil industry has become thick , sick , and have been able to have some bad place , bad ones .
now you were taken on the same time and the same number of the eye was just launched the spread that the street were used to the street .
they do n't have to eat the days , so they eat twice as much as much as much .
and this eye is a commercial game and healthy and it does n't have any way of a trick .
both of them have been eating with lunch .
both of them are getting much longer food .
that one sick and the other healthy .
what 's happening there ?
it will be a process called `` the '' ''
whenever they start organisms or cells , food way from the organism , are in the cell areas , or in the cell or are able to make energy cells to make energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see , like the cell , they 're actually used to form , are mainly mainly by the community community that 's doing during time .
and then the failure with the colony that the bears are going to be able to go into the nest , and the cell will be used to the cell .
and there are an fake number that you 're in an living store in the limits of the limits .
it 's really not the mobile force of the eye , or by the way that 's often coming away from the eye .
so , to put it out , the way to make the local standard , they were in various organisms .
and it 's probably to say that it works with people .
and we learn that they 're not like , you know , like , in the game , you should be able to fight in any small eye on the day .
no .
it 's not when you have hunger , ah , maybe the eye will come away .
if your hunger 's hunger like a friend .
and that makes sense in its own ways .
now , as a result , nine nine of human history has been what is the person when he had hungry ?
right , he was gone .
we 're going to break in the fridge when we 're hungry .
and that 's certainly against biology biology .
now , we know , and this is already in the bible , where there are white , in the game of some people who are willing to be willing , but the meat is weak .
the fear is looking at all the way different .
here 's where we showed up from the upper face here in a half garden .
the three stop days , this is good , the food that eat up all the day , as well , as we 're doing .
and that 's kind of the real eye game .
so we did that we did looking at the search for the fuel , which is the power response to the presence of the presence of survival growth .
that could be interesting for people who are n't doing not enough to the presence of the way .
and it might be focused on one of the world 's the world .
so the question is we can do the presence , the eye , the way you eat the body , even though you eat ?
and we have many hundred hundred , in the thousand health , natural health 's natural .
we 've got a past job that is called the end of us .
so , a clever thing that is in all organisms that are happening in all organisms that will be less in all organisms during the weapon of surgery .
it 's the skin in the end .
so , with a lot of time are now , less than the skin of your skin .
now if we give now , we have the cells to human cells , for example , this is what 's here .
this is just famous famous cell here .
so the trick we give up is the end on this , and we see a lot of these little thousand of these little thousand these little things in the cell , we get the supply supply , the
and then , you know , cells would look like that .
and this works in various organisms .
so , for example , i 've shown you with a game .
so we 've got our pieces up there , we 've found the molecular idea about what we 're doing .
life is also longer longer longer .
and the answer is , you see , there were typical eye of the eye .
they 're simple at the ones .
after the day , they 're all dead and then in the circle of time , it 's about half dead .
whenever we put out there , we put into water , and they 're in 2050 and survive better .
we also know that human cells that we 're going to see from the individual flowers of the culture , have about three times as long as we put them with a eye .
and the latest research was also close to close close that the life will come out of all the whole way that it 's going to come around .
and it 's not just the life , it 's also the ones also .
these are all the areas that are clearly the common ones .
so .
now , of course you know everybody know where are you going to be coming from ?
like the name says , it 's been discovered in the process of the gas process , there 's been happening in the very high community ,
but i can just a lawyer problem , too , called the time called the world 's way called called cheese , and a product of the eye , which is the fact that in japan , that 's so much they 're going out .
and then we said to say , if you do with the power , by the way to make your app 's your body community , might be able to make the phosphorus care that might be to do the phosphorus ?
because , in fact , the common sense of all the most online conditions is that is that the common community is that the era of life is in the brain .
and we did experiments .
they 're wondering we 've done the way we 've got flies .
and that 's also the original condition that we 're going to be on when you 're going to be old .
they have done more in the brain when they 're going to get old .
and the electric pattern that are in memory are quite similar for people .
now , ask yourself , what the devil has been the memory of the process ?
this is the experiment , what we 've made with a lot of common programs from college consumption .
you take a hundred blocks plants , and you will end up there a little bit you love that one you love .
marcus .
and let 's have on this eye ,
and then take the same tree , put them into the next shirt and give them other little boxes you love , and that is the trick .
we 're going to enjoy them the eye while the eye , as you were doing the eye .
you 're doing the heart 's face .
and then take the same fly back , you do it in the front .
you can go down the stage here in the stage , there you see .
and if you get down here , you give you from one side , and from other side of it .
where do they all go ?
sure .
somi go to the audio place .
except two here .
these are the eye .
or , let 's say , you have character .
i love my eye and i do n't let me say so much , like some hundred acres of the time .
okay .
but it 's also the form of the character that 's going to drive with the age .
not just fly .
and we could actually fly the eye around the way through the eye , in the eye , to the way we get a trick , and then bring back to a way .
and the ones that come down in the brain was again .
it means , you can not only do against cancer , but against the demand , may you have .
and that 's important because we do n't use the way we do n't use the way of the net in the middle of the web .
it does n't make sense that the game are doing it .
and i do n't want them to go without a few , and give you a few of them we may have remain younger .
even a game 's been done .
it 's not about what you reduce weight or anything .
by the way , there were some group there in austria , people who eat one day and they do n't eat a day .
this is so called cold to go under the rise of the rise of the body 's body and the immediate feet of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name
and they are very good by doing it .
that means it 's the game .
stop the sound .
it 's not about not being able to be dangerous complex , at all .
it 's really for candy .
now , you now know that the online being be sustainable to send diabetes , even if they 're younger employees .
and you also know that sugar can make the growth of tumors .
here you have done now , they were crying .
after 30 days , all dead .
very low applications are coming up with all the rich .
so , to create a game ,
there 's just one example of it , and almost all organisms work in all organisms .
eat together , food are growing vegetables and vegetables .
do you tell the gift of an eye or the eye at all .
you know , you know that you can see there -- and you can see cancer .
this is not true of the conditions of vitamin conditions .
we 're now being a trick in the winter , because vitamin d is put by sunlight by sunlight .
at least at least three times half a week half an hour , that 's great .
in fact , in terms of a hell of some example , there are some examples in the world 10 to 13 years .
do n't want the evidence that 's even a little bit about the time the side of the page .
the impact of `` universal '' and pressure on life is the life of ``
because the way in the boat , they live almost as long .
so with the interaction , they 're both as a game .
life longer than the end .
but they 're still able to do the end of the eye .
just close , you know , the game goes .
what is that ?
people think that they had to do with a difference of scale .
in fact , there 's a simple simple thing .
now , if you 're now at the window , you know , you 're going to lose yourself in the window , i call it the answer i 'm going to go out to the answer .
and what happens , what happens happens to happen in its mind .
so you can get rid of the eye and so what , is that you are going to get the circumstances in the circumstances .
and that 's why the way are doing , though , were really involved in effect .
a wise partner , or four family is the family with longevity .
they should n't live at a much more open road .
now , think of the same way .
but that 's nothing to do with you at all .
it 's about a number of scale .
you can ever measure the way you 're looking closer at a much more lower road , the more you have in the blood , you know in the blood .
and that 's what he says , i 've been used to be used to me .
i can love up at good sleep , and the noise does n't make me .
right , yeah .
he still has more security in the blood , and that 's bad .
there should be to be limited because of course , for sure .
we now know that there 's very good impacts effects .
and of course , it can be getting to become the issue of the matter .
and we also know that that is mysterious and the way we 're using the environmental systems against the body .
by the way , our colleagues knew we 've been with the ones and so on the way we have the game .
it does n't matter without sense .
several studies have been trying to have dark chocolate against dying with the way that 's when you can make themselves .
just recently , a beautiful study high now , which showed that were half the dark , dark chocolate per day , the will get to bring the presence of a eye of a eye .
and you know , you know , you know , you know , from coffee here , the beginning are in the ground .
there are studies that show this , there are studies that do n't show that .
what 's clear is that coffee works to be a way to diabetes and make her suffering for diabetes .
and the coffee is also a good trick because it will be able to show up how we could show us together with a common deal of paris .
and we had very beautiful and famous study in the 100 people in the hundred people , it 's shown for the hundred years that were going to eat a few living to their power to do their power to meet the power .
this is an enormous value for the study of the study .
it 's true of speech , music music , ooh , the eye , the eye , the eye .
but not for the brain model i 've actually seen the simulation thing in the world .
the only one you 're going to call more places , okay ?
that 's actually a real fact .
so for example , it does n't .
the next thing is a little bit of an adventure .
just avoid is to do a lot of animal stuff , so on meat and power , but only when they 're between the ones and say .
and we 've got a very nice study , very nice study , that you can actually do in this point too light to you so much that if you were a strong deal of water .
it does n't matter where animal proteins are good and on earth to children and have of teenagers who need to have the light and have not done it and does n't want to be in the age and those who want to be
it 's going to avoid the end of the face .
whatever you do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , already , you know , you 've been told about the fact that i said , has a crazy number , the eye , the terrible brain
all that would be put into the maggots .
this is the gentleman who lived in about this piece of grass and he has become his mind in his age .
he comes from my home when he is never sick .
it 's very good about it .
he 's not a while , not ever heard about any of the price of any time he lives in the eye where there 's particularly a lot of healthy users .
he followed around the eye , which i realized today .
we should be able to do the online experiments , but not a important fact that 's not happening in the presence of experiments , but we should n't get there .
and that is that the evolution of paper paper is not being a social tool , and that 's what i 'm being like to be a escape system .
you 're going to be less at the old people , and you could be one of our own the kind of mistakes that we 're in the order .
now , in the end of the eye , the biggest novel wrote a year ago , before , was on his death .
the brothers with the left results .
a work of working on english 's disease , especially , especially high cancer security .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question i 'm here to show you .
now , where nobody else must say , because that is a little bit of a more more a more more a more more who 's going to get killed ?
the mystery is very small .
and i thought about it .
it 's probably a reason of why they do n't test , people would have to be able to get in themselves , right ?
a lot of people come to live in the same room and so they would be in the end and think , in fact .
and so in fact , that 's not the case at all .
you see in this , in fact , is actually a phenomenon of people as being alone than alone .
and maybe it 's also that you do n't test them because the question is going to be replaced .
do you feel that in a lonely or is you get a lonely ?
you can feel chocolate without being having a lonely .
and you can be treated and feel you get some of them on that moment .
let me also do a lot to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
that 's also going to be flying here to be here to be a few here .
so , here is going to be in touch , and you can see in a game of yourself .
let 's take a time .
and also , nobody gets looked at here in the few seconds i gave them .
let 's have to be able to do that .
so , let 's have that time , and that 's time to be able to be aware of your own being .
and this is something that also need to do a exercise for being able to talk about it .
and this is the exercise we do n't do at the whole exercise .
we do n't have the language for us to have sign for ourselves to identify ourselves when we are , when are we treated ?
there 's two to the late eye i 've always ever ever ever ever ever .
so , the one part of the human world says , you have some of them from the beginning of fish .
from the birth , the death is , in fact , in death , in the death .
there are few moments in life where you can get to the power .
people often go to go into the way , and drive up all the day .
i do n't have any time , so i can go .
and then , there are less than maybe strangers , which say everything is connected .
i do n't have that , well , i 'm just part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group i 've seen for you , and think that you think .
so they think , okay , today i 'm getting chicken and on the next day , to come out , it 's all together .
when we think of something we 're thinking about , always one big being a big challenge .
the advice of the middle room , the head of the person on an accident .
but about these eye , about this great eye game , i do n't even talk about today , but i want to talk about the small ones that are also able to make us in such a theater .
i do n't want to talk about a burden of movement and the game .
let 's not find back from other level of the other thing , in example , at the other hand , that 's already hard to us already already have us on .
the six and the half paper machine are actually built with a few photos , which i want to show you .
how easy it is to discover us in other angeles .
and we all know , all of us do n't know if these people are really going to have some people that they 're in that moment .
but who does n't know the moment you have to do the moment where you think all are going to talk to each other , you only ca n't lost yourself in the corner , and nobody 's going to turn
so , we all know that , you know , these are a lot of people 's know that they all know .
maybe some you 've experienced today .
what you do was the phone of the most often , you know , that was a very good thing to watch up the eye on the mobile cell cell , you know , a stick in the center before the web .
and it looks visible if you look at the screen .
now , what we do n't do here .
yes , and then there is the curious that in front of you is the ted 's going to go back to a game , and you see something that is left in hope that you ca n't forget his text .
these are the ones that you see from the outside .
so we were responsible for other people to help .
but i 'm sure there 's people in the room who feel so they 're so willing to feel like they have tried to have all their lives , by doing this memory of the whole ones , and they 're moving off .
and there 's a place that are well known to people who are infected because they need to give them in another people , it 's about death or of a stream .
and so there 's nothing that we use to do , that many people , are connected with them , they 're feeling lonely .
and there are people who have lost themselves , and they 're not going to get to turn further and they 're so lonely .
i do the digital memory .
and they 're going to put it in the target business .
the adult department of advice , we know .
these are people who think after social distribution .
it 's always relatively .
there are no strange number , not any of any amount of being much of any other , when anybody have n't .
and we 're immediately seeing the old people immediately .
it 's the emergence of cheap 's cheap .
but since we 're all living in cities , we 've all become close to facebook or by twitter or facebook is that digital memory has bigger , and you can always have a bigger way to get bigger .
you can be connected with hundreds of people without being able to be right with one people .
it 's a rather more rather a rather rather a rather rather the amount of human relations , rather than it is missing to the digital community of the relationships .
the two forms of god will very often about each other .
and that 's also that the mosquito house made a little bit about a little bit , a little bit .
whereas digital , the digital memory of all , well , is good for the power and signs .
it 's about that the digital memory in the future is still more likely to be more than the possibilities of being to connect , and it 's bigger .
i do n't know if i feel that feeling of being a way of being a very similar , in the age of an example is even more even more challenging .
or if you can find a new term for this .
but that 's the problems of the problems of the generation .
almost bigger than the world itself is the fear of the house and the fear of the protection , people are doing more to do some .
so with the big interview , a trick 's person has written a wonderful trick to have been written out .
in this point , they 're wearing what people do everything to be alone .
they build a bit and they build their kids who are then lonely and just alone .
but it 's not one to actually get fear from the house , which spend money .
toilet cancer go .
things are being universal .
and both the process , we have a lot of , the late bit , because it 's because it 's at least a `` a '' of a contact in least and the objects that you 've described .
the problem is that it 's very short , very , it 's very , it 's very , it 's very , and is to stop this kind of led against the house .
so we 're going to buy new things we 've got to get in the same time .
i saw the advertising for a major incredibly market system .
and the eye is moving up from mobile communication with the edge of the line you could have the size of it .
what 's going to do with is not to do with the bird 's thing , but it 's certainly known that .
so , there 's nothing to do something to do around the web center , and that is what it comes to people under people .
so there 's a great poem written , and there 's a funny case in the worst of the house is that in second .
hand on the heart who does n't know that ?
in a relationship , in or the way or the other one or the other ones to buy , and suddenly , terrible alone , to feel terrible birds and the question that 's the question of who 's actually being ?
did i do something about that at all ?
one study tells women around the rate , for married , they feel kids .
evidence , because i 'm not really know whether i study myself the study , i 'm told you .
but also , we do n't really have no matter now , because at least , it 's not possible at studies , and the response is always the same and the same response in front of me .
that is a very sense of light , almost already have already a trick .
let 's talk about that memory to second , every great and yet , let 's talk about them .
talk so much about the example of the sex city in sex .
and that probably probably happened .
while we 're going to be a lot while , what do i think here ?
who is this person in my bed ?
and also , the form of god does n't necessarily have to do what has to do with the quality of your heart path along the quality of your best way .
nothing to do with the quality of relationship has to do .
it 's just there .
we 're not talking about them because we do n't look at them .
we 're just right to talk about it in the workforce .
in the lab , we also think that in the lab .
i was on the end of the eye , and i see a group of five when i said , it 's said three , three of them , and two people get a little bit .
two men have begun to have a two women in the lung .
and in between between , there were something so with the arts 's eye with the arts 's hand .
i think that , i do n't have to do the scene on you to get them in the front of the form of something that has been in its own business in the lab .
it 's the head of the game .
but it 's also the head of the eye as well .
we all know that are the ones , or i see , here are some who 's going to get your life to follow .
in business , in general entrepreneurs , often , often , the often thing about who they 're actually what they 're doing .
where they are where they curve .
this is a form of something that is not talking about .
it 's just like it is how to be cut out as it could be to be consistent as a while .
and it 's about all over here .
i told me that he told me he was called `` the '' '' and i said , `` it 's all '' and what 's happened , you ca n't imagine it .
a trick was in the front of the hospital .
he 's so at himself to make himself go into a time .
and two months later he 's more more than more than more months later .
the memory of the god are never coming .
it 's always coming in connection with other emotions .
she has beautiful brown , and she has in black square .
the majority of the most of the thing is we all know .
fear , artificial despair , were in the front of the box .
but we should n't forget the nice epidemic as well .
the freedom that tell the end of the things that they have the end of the game .
and so my favorite check the way that they take out of .
come and more and more dry and more .
let them and do n't you take you .
because there 's something much more than a lot than the ted and that 's the empty that you might think about , you know , if you 're not a little bit away .
and so , let 's be part of life .
so i 've thought so hard about all over a lot of time in a period of time for me to change two things .
for one in my childhood age , i did n't have a really like a broken life center since i was that i always was to have a little life of the way to have anyone who would n't have me , because i may lose people , maybe
and i 've been there since i 've been able to come through the head of advice in my life , and let people come to people .
so it 's with the interaction that you do .
there 's a lot of free too .
people come and to let them not immediately immediately to go at whether they could get a train or at their own own time or even a relationship .
as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
you can not start those a eye without somebody to start with somebody a conversation for a conversation .
whether in the eye or in the economy .
every time it was about to be successful .
as a child , i found some embarrassing .
as a young adult , i have become incredibly incredibly incredibly an incredibly for the idea to have this openness .
but only i ever ever ever ever see with that to the strange time , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , i went back to open up and open up .
you can be treated , you 're going to have ready for the next one .
thank you .
yeah , thank you very much .
i mean , there 's three pieces of things here .
there 's a game you can get you to get a game with you .
now , i ask you to ask you , if you just do , any of them , you know , `` you would like to take any more , '' you would take him ?
most of them would decide for the game .
and that 's an really good idea .
and why ?
because we have the other effort to make the biggest effect in the biggest effect .
we do somehow make it a sort of different .
we can see that we can make the one up with the biggest effect completely than eight and a chance for other strategy .
for example , we decide for the ones and the sports for sports .
big , big activity .
that 's why it does n't pretty valuable .
or we decide for the turn .
that 's where food food .
very large now are still very much more effort .
so for me , so not that is that way .
and i want to tell you today today that i need to make the biggest effort the biggest to the biggest effort .
when you 're doing more and more and more independent and health , you 're not very much at it in this .
and this is what 's about the topic .
and the theme of that was n't a topic for germany , so far to the eye .
and then the number of people went to a lot .
and i asked me , what was there in the interview ?
why did it suddenly be up to up ?
and i have been doing research , and i have become a trained card .
because it was exactly the same in the years .
what was there ?
there we came to germany .
and we 're always going to be more and more effective ?
and i kept on a time .
there 's coming to germany .
and the swim goes up .
and in fact , the curve in the curve is really really moving from it .
what then comes to germany ?
so you can go and go and go and go and how that means .
and we 're always going to be more and more effective ?
well , then i got one and one thing .
because it was clear .
sports is thick .
and of course , i do n't mean , of course , of the moment today to tell you that , that is a little bit of an thick power .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've seen in common .
the air had new training , and they did n't stop to get out that we 're going to get to get away and get smarter .
what is it ?
the food ?
and also there are been quite great trial from the states .
and also they have the problem with about obesity .
and they introduced into the eye .
and then they wanted to look at what 's going to happen ?
and you saw , people are actually going to make less fat , but people are always getting less calories , still more stable .
and that was incredible .
and so they have called the eye .
you can explain that ?
you can imagine the body as a power power .
there 's so big eye systems .
and on one side comes up a eye , since we do the whole bubble of this , they 'll get them up here .
and there 's the energy coming together as electricity .
now , if we 're doing more than we 're going to give more more an more more and more intelligent power here in our power system than we use it on the other side , the energy is doing it in the power , and it 's the
the human body does n't make the same thing .
that can be built the energy .
and in the form of the fat , it 's in the form of fat .
our greatest and safety are doing .
what happens if we 've heard less as we 've heard , energy , and yet the energy 's energy , and the energy will only be beginning to end .
the eye has grown apart .
there 's no life at all of the life .
we are only stem cells .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents were still left for 20 miles to foot .
and we 're now coming up to two miles , and those are the positive opportunity .
there 's studies that report in five -- until feet down .
i do tell you the thing that i tell you with my friend fiction .
do n't you give me a degree of the chair ?
mike , you know , a little number of time you 're ?
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he 's not much more talk .
and he was at this study , and now , here .
he 's actually a typical story , the head of head , and he has a trick in the hand .
and mike , they eat less and less and takes less , and yet he 's always getting more and more stable .
why ?
because , you know , mike only is .
and i looked at a slide with how much movement i lost such like that day and put him up at the back of the pocket , and i had the evening back to the evening .
and there was a thousand steps .
this is the distance that mike was sitting on the morning to the car with the car to the car , of course , of course , a little bit of coffee , and back to the car .
and he came up in a thousand steps .
that 's called the name of that day , 10 minutes on his legs .
and you can say , you know , at the age of hours , or about a famous minutes was a famous bush , or was a name .
among these conditions , what 's disease is about .
and then , mike does n't matter and he 's not going to be in too much because it 's going to be so long , and he used to do energy on that but he 's not using more and the energy will go .
and we first do n't get the energy as you see here at his eye .
but energy is the right , not there is not there .
and then back at the end of the blood .
and there 's where they 're active and they 're quiet and quiet in the eye .
so the cyclist kingdom .
so if the energy at blood , then the doctors are going to get in high charge ] ] ] ] ] ] about it .
and this black genome , the eye , like a disaster game , is doing small holes in the eye .
and so happiness is a very lucky way to look at the fat around and the end is now over these little square and we talk about this little eye or a gas disease or a gas disease .
and now , comes right under heart pressure , because now he needs to be the blood through that with a eye and the blood is talking about the blood , and we talk about the blood age .
and if this cartoon does like you go to that , it 's also going in the body .
and if that 's on the heart , we call a heart heart attack .
and when that 's what in the head , we call the apple about the phone .
and also in germany , every second of the world 's heart and rocks were dying .
that means , in germany , every second in the second day .
so , mike is n't really , because he does n't get a person , but he did n't move it all the way .
and if you do n't know that the idea , you always look at the wrong place .
so for example , for example , a diet diet diet .
i 've got a diet yesterday at amazon , and there are so real to the front of you are doing the eye , right now .
and if every book is only this , i 'm a plane , and we would see that there , we would have a 30 feet of high a lot of an area .
and i read the time that read for you all .
and there 's in inside , and this is really important if you do n't take any energy in the same than they 're using them to do it .
and if you do less energy than you 're using , you 'll use it .
this is a brilliant thing .
but why do we need to get into real books ?
that 's just one thing to finish .
the need is , of course , huge but not help help us help .
because what 's funny a diet for a diet to a million percent ?
because it 's a diet , and it does n't really get a lifestyle .
what do the difference that we do here here is three weeks here , and here we 've got five weeks , if we fight back to this fight , to our normal life , to our normal lifestyle .
what does it do to five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except big and back a public system in orbit we do n't have done what we 've done .
so you can ask it today to any new diet in every new eye in every new game , and then they want to ask this in their daily online to their own life .
yes , no ?
and then , please go .
and if you just do it , you 'll stay it .
because if you get nothing on the end , it 's pretty good , it 's just a good time .
it 's the behavior that you want to decide whether we 're sick or healthy .
it 's the bad resource that make us sick .
and it 's the good habits that make us healthy .
and then when you look at the mirror in the mirror , he 's going to see the result of his daily lifestyle .
when you look at the mirror in the mirror , he 's going to see his daily habits .
and when you look at the mirror in the mirror and it 's honest , it looks where it looks .
because if it comes to bad bad habits than a good thing , it just gone on the disease .
and when i ended up then in the direction , the way that 's the way to make health , the direction of goals , he does n't have to be able to look for his whole life .
and then he just needs more good habits than bad behavior .
and a media behavior is also a great example of a strange man that man has a strange animal .
and then , for example , it has done it , and it 's just completely made out of his day , by putting every way to each way with the car , each way to put with each way , put together in each way , using each
and in the evening , he would be talking to the speed , and to get some underwater north down again .
so he put up in his eye with an vulnerable to the top thing , which is the buddha on top of the street , and then it 's going to be as if it was so rare to be a band of the band he somehow comes back
and my favorite inspired was exactly as the way they could .
and that was the water and it did n't understand it .
i said , we had a sports , to get a people who do n't move .
and somehow he did right .
why do we always have to make that way in the same time , will what we have in the daily cell cell cell cell food ?
so we have to do out of the way that we have to do today with these at this game , we have to share two hours a day .
and then we 've got a lot of simple simple to find the movement where we lost it .
they used to be in the daily day .
and so , i invite you a way to get a body perspective today .
maybe you may know the situation , you see , you see , you know , you 're going to go down the time , and you 're also , that in the early series , it 's not a place .
and you see how to see this eye in that eye .
we 're always trying to go out for the production of it .
we plan our homes so that we have a way of making it together .
we plan our whole life so that we have a way to do it , but yet it does n't work where we 're doing .
it 's a very different direction .
and so you can go to the front today today , and it 's the movement that it 's running out where it 's happening .
i love to be able to say that was the best thing .
and i 'm the only one who goes up and down and up and down and go to it and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go
but i 've already been there to the way i 'm doing the time i 'm doing it .
and i then the movement is that there is just that way .
and when the aliens comes down , 30 minutes of it , 30 minutes , i say , `` i ''
you know , in your earliest steps .
that 's about three minutes to think about three times 10 .
and a media cultural steps when you 're going to be careful every day , you know , your day are now far more , and then you can not mean that you 're not going to get away from the end of your body .
that may be relatively little bit sound .
but as a result of , as a medical community , i 'm going to speak about four pounds of them five and four .
we do n't have that in our body .
and you give me a degree of time , i 'll get him to him .
the americans are crazy , the idea of the question is what 's going here .
this is a trick from five pounds .
now , there are been four pounds for me .
just to see what happens with these little shoes .
and if that 's the effect of the perspective , what you 're doing , what i 'm doing if you start to start in a active life .
and you can get these eye down every day every day .
once you were there at the time a day , you almost walk on all of this .
and if you 're going to go and that time , they do , they do the top .
then you still have the end next to the game .
they 're also going to be faster and stronger .
but they do n't do their health on sports .
so you do n't do your health on your health and the time of your time .
because the most important thing that 's doing is that the most important thing you 're doing is your day .
and i 'm going to make a really figure on you ,
and for me , it 's more than a key issue for me to be a clear decision for life and for myself .
because i think health does n't really do what to do or to do .
so , for example , is to do with what we want to do .
and that 's why i 'm still going to be a idea for you today .
just decide just to the best of you today .
and over now , you know how it goes .
step for a step .
thank you very much indeed .
so how does it have an leonardo of leonardo , actually , to make incredible , white way , white way to see the world with other eyes ?
and then , in fact , what 's happening is that far on itself , which is to be said just to be heard of what 's happened to just just simply simply , is n't it ?
could we also be a way that 's what could we do today ?
what might possibly be what to do with tumors ?
and how can we get power and have to get some of our future ?
now , let 's start with this question with what 's a question of what 's actually a question of innovation actually do ?
sure .
technology research , and development is the strange thing of government even at the government of the government .
so , really , really understand .
that 's all great .
and we can be quite proud of what we can be , and grateful that we are going to be able to do that in these very many high , everywhere that our minds would be able to have us to go well .
that we have such extraordinary prosperity with this .
but what about the future ?
what do you come to do out as a society like a society ?
and who does the big deal of dna and social challenges ?
so you seem to be kind of going to be the end of the end .
it 's a kind of impact .
so the economy is going to be able to take the relationship of the relationship because of the entrepreneurs that we can then get big effort with that .
and the way that the world is going to do better is what 's going to find in low organizations and market organizations , and also what companies are going to do is to take it to the root of the traditional economy of economies .
at least , at least .
but who tells you that we have to look at all of these all the whole as we have to look at ?
so how if we 're going to go to the minds about these social social dimension and cultural dimension ?
if any innovation at the same time , same cultural innovation , are you ?
when the economic innovation at the same thing is , what are social innovations at the same time ?
if it 's more and more things that we think about how to do it with the solution of big development and social media care and social media care and social development care and social care ?
if you 're doing some other forces , your forces , and if you make us feel different , we have a whole different , dangerous mental health development ?
so how did that ?
both sides , but what companies are , right ?
can we do that ?
you may ask , you may be in a way .
so we 've always got that already , and it 's as a contradiction .
fortunately , we have more example of examples .
now , the law of military has shown , with his business , with a lot of power to the poverty there .
and interestingly , much more than the easy thing to do is actually done the government ' with .
and he has the head of a entrepreneur , probably , of course , the peace market got the peace trick with the peace spot with that .
the opportunity with me , i just have to do with someone 's familiar ,
and , yeah , can i have touched the eye .
light , a great guy .
great trained , but has also been rid of its own killer .
and yeah , there 's totally eye there .
i love right .
and if you see the fish , you think about the fish , we need our future , we do n't have to worry about our future .
yes , in the morning , he came up somewhere somewhere somewhere in one of our eye 's eye ,
he 's doing that 's all pretty good .
that 's like him like it 's totally successful , too .
and yet , there 's some way that 's going to happen in him .
so he asks that there 's no more more , kind of thing in me ?
that 's the time the oxytocin says he 's going .
dolphins are all the ones .
and then that 's like him too .
and he also liked these eye skills .
so there 's also the eye there that he has the same eye in the right ,
so not that he knows for him to be personal , but the trick is what they 're saying .
and there 's no three times he did n't know .
so , more than that he was surprised when he was turned out the idea of the open to him .
as a result , the game is about .
and as a national treatment , he would come in there .
which is great joy , so with young people , there 's his own experience .
and the two of them found out each other .
and they always met each other .
so , how if we even have so much of those conversations from the two time ?
yes , you know , it 's been on the game of the way that was the same thing again .
what is the same between the presence between the eye and the crime of a business ?
and i do n't have that way .
yes , so what we 're looking at is the question of what is the world 's question to do is in the question of business ?
so i name , `` it 's already already . ''
immediate markets , creative products , mental structures , there is an illusion .
and you can also have a very big deal of this , where the big deal of shapes changes .
and once we were done before , even though the whole thing is , it can also be off .
so , what 's a trick ?
so , you 're going to pick up , so you ca n't do it , it 's exactly the little one of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it 's a completely different character .
because it has nothing to be left .
no more an extra customers , no food , nothing known .
so , from that is an abstract organization , an example of a business organization is to develop the web system , which , of course , is a business being been alive , and then forth ?
and you 're going to understand that there are other organization going out to be a different organization in the organization very different of ways , and you know , other are different , very different ways .
yes , i 've seen it clear .
but after what ? actually , in ?
so , i 'm going to be talking about where it 's all you make is to make money you like you ?
so i was standing there , which is pretty good , so that thomas research found what i mean , i 'm going to do that ?
that 's the end of the eye .
how you get to do your business and have long life long after you get on your own life .
oh no .
real security ?
what do you think about your start and you have to do your own money , and then after it 's time ?
so you get a career as a normal trick , or what ?
what happens to your engagement , what 's so like , is i know ?
and also , we 're looking at the eye .
so the statistics about the eye will not come a board perspective of perspective , because of course , for any percent of all the ones , they 've already already come for a much more more more more more financial situation than they go .
money is always the result of a successful company and a good kind of light company .
sure , money is a consumer effect for consumers .
and it 's all economic growth .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
then , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i 'm a living , i learned , so without the goal is n't a way of the right way .
and so goals really has to be limited and so in some of the , and goals actually has to be in and so on .
and if i do n't have anything that i do , how can i look something about that i do n't know what i 'm going to look for ?
so that does n't feel good feeling .
so how do i decide , and , and risks that is , i feel like everything and the risks of the things .
yes , you welcome to the rock court .
but i may be able to call the way for you .
a thread .
so , you know , that 's already already a trick , so almost secret .
successful at generation , they used to find into generation ,
a stick with the top of the flight .
so , what do you say today ?
so i 'm going to say , do ?
so we 're always saying about it .
in multiple financial crisis and rich and the immediate environmental engineering system .
so it will have a difference
i mean , i can leave them one .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister laughter .
but there 's just a question of it .
so you can see that this can be an important to create the important best windows of drug medicine , you can ask good questions .
can we tell one of them after the other people i can possibly understand better ?
so , the first one is , what am i here and what i would like to do here ?
yes , it 's been , you know , there 's the way you can see that , that 's bigger than you ?
so what do you do on the world ?
what did people have when they work with you ?
what are you ready to give ?
what are your inside , maybe is being wrong ?
why is this important to see ?
because these are your favorite skills that are like .
and how do we learn that ?
if you want to do a ship , you do n't make the men together together , you know , men together , they do n't do a hot hot place , but they teach them , they would say they 'd be , to do it , the
yes , good .
so i then look at the next questions .
what 's my online doing ?
what does that mean ?
yes , you 're going to be able to do to do your target .
it 's almost a lot of color colors , so i 'm afraid you 're in a moment , you 're just in a moment where you 're going to be your eye , you 'll be playing you .
do you know what 's a pink story ?
that 's what i can do there .
do n't ?
self-deception .
so , look at all of you .
you 're not going to be a pink elephant .
okay ?
does it work ?
so , you have a pink elephant .
did i understand ?
no german elephant .
do you see ?
that 's how we focus on the end of what we do n't want .
what is there the only way ?
there are you ?
yes , remember , you know , what you want to do .
so you might say the road systems on the end .
but they 're being used to join you .
by the way , what 's going to do , is you where you 're going to look at you ?
i brought you with a tour .
look at the interview .
now you 're going to go to the top glass video ,
who ?
and the same time is a death of water on the top with a eye ,
i have a lot of the things that you are doing with the same time that you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
i get the glass in the scene .
i mean , i do n't have a look at the eye , sir .
and i have a game going into the eye .
marcus 's japanese 's name .
oh , `` what 's the first thing i 'm going to do is you know what you 're wearing ? ''
so the cybercriminals , the cybercriminals , are still carrying there with you as a game game there 's a game number you 've seen .
so i 'm influenced with you with a story
it 's not a point of a place of the eye .
real , the trick is the original online to make you step with ?
and lo like this , it looks like ?
is you notice what you 've noticed ?
does anything change ?
okay .
okay , the flower and the flower too .
okay .
so then we 're looking at a look at the play once .
and doing a action job problem .
now you 're going to go to the top glass video ,
who ?
and the same time is a death of water on the top with a eye ,
i have a lot of the things that you are doing to the face of the time that you see , you know , the time of the place that make you place place , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
i get the glass in the scene .
i mean , i do n't have a look at the eye , sir .
and i have a game going into the eye .
marcus 's japanese 's name .
and lo , how are you going to make it ?
so , i know i was shocked .
i was shocked .
when i first saw it .
i do n't think i was n't being .
and even more and many more , i went through my head , is that i was actually really doing all the time around the planet ?
i live through my life .
and okay , i 'm sure that is totally sense .
to prevent the immediate bomb , we need to prevent the most of our perception and our eye .
but what happens to happen ?
what else i was talking about , and what am i doing ?
and therefore , you know , finding your perception of being able to be able to get there , and then is just more important quality quality .
well , yeah , so , thank you take the next question .
how could i get to my goal ?
so , that 's me , i 'm going to find a good question .
because i also ask me , and i do n't know anything too .
yes , uh-huh , there are good news for you .
that 's going to fall easier as you 've done before .
because if you 're clear to your local , your inner head , and if you have a color goal of your color , i 've told you that i 'm going to happen to be able to happen there at all .
almost it , it 's almost a way .
you do n't really , you know , as a nuclear war into you , you 're going to get out of you .
that 's the famous place you 've got in the hospital in the hospital .
and yet , the question of the time , i 'm looking at you looking at , are some ways , who you are , you know , are you for how you could ask for advice to do more ways to look at them with a more more
and you also have a big model .
the world model model has been able to use this great ,
by many hundred words ' shows , if the wrong is n't all the longer , has invited to be invited in its lifetime .
let 's go to lunch at the famous big table .
and this is totally different people .
so scientists , politicians , oxygen engineers , fresh engineers , architects , architects , and he was very deeply a way of being a way of being a result .
but not in our way today 's sense of the way that 's the most important thing , yes , who is the spread in ?
who 's right ?
but really , suddenly , of these different things , they have come out of things , no way that we have something that could have come up by that would have come up by all .
well , the next question is that , what do i do with this next person ?
so you can be able to suggest that successful entrepreneurs are very simple .
instead of getting large and cute and so on , they just focus on the next step .
because what do you want to do in the area of uncertainty ?
but it makes this really embarrassing and it 's all the consequence .
and if it was nothing , dan is going to look at , go up with another step .
and even if the big deal there , there were a lot of them who do n't want to do others .
so it 's so important that you 're clear what 's going to see .
that 's the inner security security .
and in the rest of the rest , how do we all learned that walk on ?
although we did n't , we did n't know , and it 's no way they 've been told ?
now , in fact , you 're going to be very serious at kids .
so , this lovely learning learning , this very good search and this eye is that fun is to make fun happen in a company in the eye .
and that 's exactly what 's going on for the uncertainty of the uncertainty that otherwise , you know , it does n't get us so .
yes , thank you so much .
so this is all really well .
so i do n't know when i was in my company , where i have to do that , i have to change where many of us have to change there , and i think that there 's something something happening there .
and even this way in germany , always is always the very mood .
and i call up , because the politicians would be worried that it changes .
okay , my boy , come with me .
you 've got down down here down the water .
what do you think about how many people can do , they can change ?
ten ?
10,000 ?
ten million ?
look down the way down here .
who do you see ?
right .
this is where you can change that you really can change .
or to make it be real , just looking at the change that you are in the world 's world in the world .
think of beautiful people and big role technologies , but how do you want to work ?
so , we have the lucky few eye of the eye in our eye .
so i go to you go to the end of crisis , or if you make yourself small , or if you get a billion , and you all have with you .
and if you 're in those situations , what are the very difficult way to do is what 's now , you 're going to take you to take your own work to feel physically to feel powerful .
ask a question of what you like to be in the ice that you 're doing is to get you out .
and so finally , what you 're actually at this crisis or what bad happened is because he happened .
so i 've already happened to be at least at least at least .
yes , all right .
so , with example , i ca n't have a lot .
and do you think of that , i think , will help me , in my mind ?
yeah .
and again , we found two things that we 're doing .
first of all , here 's the great devil devil to her own up , then it 's going to your enemy 's place .
because that 's what your perception to perception .
and the second thing on your own inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner inner field .
because you 're doing how the other people are behavior you behave .
the future is only going to change our own perception .
do you do that ?
yeah , i 've already .
so thank you .
all the good things about you about it .
yes .
what do you think about our mouths ?
nice .
really , or do you go ?
and how do we do it , actually , are we in this with the eye ?
is this a new trick ?
i mean , yes .
you know , in fact .
so , mostly , i see the more more more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more more the more
you say , you say , you say , you say , you say , you say , `` you know , '' you know in the street 's breath .
and that 's what the trick is really really about the trick .
a trick from the most time .
no , so no , new ones , virginia .
now , that 's the game .
the only thing is about sheep 's actually not a long famous name .
from robert county called the `` a look at '' or `` a way , `` you know , like all of you are .
let 's just just just now find this mind to new mind .
and who may know what is happening from our next leonardo of leonardo in our time .
you see right , i 'm going to be a game game .
so maybe it would be rich that i would be with kids and their future emotions because they 're kids to the future .
instead , that 's what i think about the view is about most of the time .
i 've got a most part of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father has been , four years ago , and i started to be able to be the program , art community disease .
we 're talking about teaching ourselves , which means you can make yourself either and you can do , you know , you can see a little bit easier , you know , you can also think you might think .
so why am i thinking about life to do with the face , so those are the ones who are in the most who were the great mistake ?
and the program we 're much easy to understand how far the people who do n't care for children .
and frankly , i thought that the game was the presence of the last place in the universe i would work .
what do you think the most important things factor is to be in childhood with the people we work with ?
we found it 's very positive role role things often , very much , male technologies .
and if you think about why there 's so many of the people who often think about , often , that 's what the dad has no longer have a good work that he would have gotten drugs to be able to see it or that he sits in
and if a third boy then , he was thinking about what he 'd like to do was to make a better idea , and maybe it may be like another life because he has no better role role .
and he 's doing his father .
i think about martin .
martin is our program , right now .
his father was an organic and made out of the family for life .
when he died , his mother died , and he had to be a brother in the home .
there he was the eye of the big .
he was a shy and the interview and so the perfect victims .
so to the day as his little brother with a game of a game , it became that one of the ground is happening .
there was a dead death that was coming through martin 's first time he went to the enemy and to respond to the enemy .
and she 's down by this day , he was playing .
and so , here , go .
violence , now , in his life , life just like this , at his father .
now , how do we have the problem that i described , right ?
after childhood childhood after the childhood , there are many sides of them or they 're having the childhood .
you do n't know much different things than your local activity and their eye .
and then they become a day with people in prison , and they see it just like that , their thoughts , to have no better role role there .
so what do you think you think these people are in common together when they 're sitting in prison in jail ?
not about much good .
and they will be able to get into better criminals .
they 're selling drugs on a higher level and plan in the high room where they could be able to go in the very short .
and this is then then coming up in germany in germany .
that means germany every single second second would have taken criminals .
then you have people in prison also , but they really want to change change .
but also , these people also carry a magic on the roof .
and there 's where it is .
and everywhere you get , that is the first identity .
whether you 're going to look at a database of a database of a database of a media job , a perfect search is a perfect private relationship where you want to build it with this identity , with this sense of , you have an ant game into
that 's the problem we are , before we are .
how do we try this problem to solve ?
what 's the quality , believe many of the food skills of the food system ?
you 're going to be surprised .
it 's more local skills .
who has built up who has definitely seen by the eye , from the eye and the eye .
the only thing that you see is a little bit of the oil is otherwise , otherwise he ca n't hit in jail .
these properties we want to use for something positive .
we start our program with a while of our online education , in three feet .
we 're putting the rise of art and engineering .
everybody wants to write its own home project , and everybody takes a different trick .
and then we got people also to get to the presence of the very eye in the eye , at the way the way to bring their personal relationships and also the eye in a different game .
what 's there for efficiency , right ?
it 's a big range of view of the end of the eye .
we have a trick .
a very large amount of work and it 's about to give you that i like to give you .
so with the demand and his own illusion from the high money , he has been thrown on the trade of the trade .
he always had to do business .
he was being raped for the first time .
and that 's not particularly embarrassing .
quite the opposite .
he says himself up today he 's prepared his second in the time .
so he was convicted for a second time .
he took up to a therapy system and then , and then the turn .
and there are how he learned his trial to do with some online process for something you can use with .
he has been moved in september the september of the day , and he 's been formed at an end of an end of the eye , is his practice in the eye .
it keeps a lot of good practice , he 's a living now .
he has made very good made to happen .
he 's today with me here .
who him like to get away to the taste of the way they want to go .
even back to martin , i 'd say that i had him at the beginning .
martin has an education after the childhood has an education , and the end of the play in his hands in the front of the eye .
and there is the building that goes out and drugs there in the agenda , it was the most cycle of the water , quite quickly .
he was working on as a woman and he 's security .
so for me , for example , for 20 years , he led this life .
and he 's saying that he was not really working out of this .
he was going to kill someone in the eye so hard that he was being convicted of being in .
he took up to the head , and the trick has changed his life .
and he learned how he could come more success and more of life could get to be the heart complex or the drugs .
and he was so excited about his view so he decided he 'd like to get him .
and he wanted to be part of the game .
this has been a nightmare rate .
he 's now working for the course of us for a two years ago , and we say our participants in the way to the way for their way to their way , because he knows that if you want to change the right tools , and if you
the basis of these successes are people like they 're in the world .
people who come to us with prison , and so they 're doing , and they have to be an eye in their order , in their personal business .
these are our favorite argument that makes us give up the eye in our education , which are what these students are doing the presence , the eye industry , the way they do .
and these are our hair , which our participants directly directly directly .
and also , these people also take a lot from our program .
one example .
we 're doing a practice called our very well .
we then go into the middle of the room a large bike program , on one and our genome are on the other side .
and i 'm going to ask different questions .
and every time you see , in the room , you know , you know , you know , he 's coming with the line of the line .
and here 's what we all have in common , if we 're sitting inside the car or outside the ] outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one of the things that you 're going to be , is the other hand , is the question .
i grew up social in a part of social school , or i had a call in a part of the social social time .
there are usually a lot of our participants at the line of the line , and only few of our genome
one question i 'd like to make all of us who are all together , i would like to put them to you .
so , i 'll tell you all of you , i 'm all once .
maybe a little light can get in the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all .
that 's amazing .
thank you .
i think , `` you know , i mean , if you ask this question , '' and then you 'll do that question , and otherwise they 're just going to stay at it .
so this is the kind of thing that we line our line we 're going to pull now .
i did not have my life in my life that i could have been depressed for , but not .
you know , if you ask this question , you 're still put it please .
and the more remarkable car is to be able to be able to be .
and the hard thing is , maybe low a low load of mass has got a lot .
and the thing that 's going is , it 's not taken to have the same thing to do .
okay .
and it 's also important to have any jobs to have quite quite accurate .
all right .
you 're most of them in the world
we have some in the room .
this is beautiful , i 'm happy .
thank you very much indeed , you 're allowed to put all again .
so this question , if we do it on the high , our genome come very often to the market market .
and many will be clear , how much luck you might have had .
happiness with the parents with the environment , and the parents that you were in america , but also the lucky way that they may not always be told in the edge of the eye or the even even done it .
what are the results of our work ?
in fact , in order to be a more percent of our students , we find a job in the eye days .
that 's just one quick fast .
the three-dimensional percent have already done their own .
a third of the french 's french was in the last year .
and our power is at seven percent .
i 'd been told to the presence of seven percent in germany in germany in germany .
i 'm a believer .
a online deal costs per year per year in the year of mexico .
and it 's a beautiful trick , food , which is at the end of seven percent of a while usually by usually a security is being means .
when my father and i , together , we 're in the front of pretty much pretty many of pretty much pretty much .
i was at the time that i gave my great eye in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i still did n't make a good work in my life .
we 're trying to encourage our participants to take responsibility .
responsibility , what 's happened in your life , is to take responsibility in what 's going to happen in your life .
not too hide , nothing to the extreme .
because it leads to a whole whole new set of information and allow it to take it to trust .
and so it makes me quite happy and proud when our participants gave me , they 're on their way .
that 's what i brought to give you a video .
movie .
so i was convicted of two years and eight months because dangerous voice is about .
i was getting because of the interview to three years and to get 10 months .
i 've gone with fire .
so , i have an incredible number of two years to do that in two years .
i was convicted of being because of the eye and the way you have with it .
so , my current engineering in my field actually changed my entire life .
and what was important for me , this is the trick that 's made about .
because there was my most absolute museum , my absolute museum .
i was n't saying , i 'd n't be , yes .
i 've gone back to an goals .
i discovered my perspective again .
and you 're going to go through a very different consciousness and the way you get away from the piano .
so far , there 's more no way to do it without effective goals , and then you 're still in anything about anything .
in the wrong people together , and now this is n't more .
well , the problem is that there 's a lot of you who are n't getting in the way of getting out there .
so this is because the biggest problem is because , it 's a matter of time you will go to the old communities .
you know nothing else .
by this very individual individual , whatever it 's all been done to me , you know , just to think of the whole way of thinking about me , to me , about others , about problems , about the way of society , that has just gone
i 've been an first time for my first wife .
and for six months , i would take up .
so that means we started a new relationship .
and because i also changed the eye and many other things have changed .
lots of them i 've done .
i started to get the education in the field of the head .
so i work in my shoulder , i would say .
i just just go to the game on the eye .
you really have to argue that , it 's very , very many people who are actually in fact , like my window , also , of course , over the time , i do n't actually know about it , i do n't know , the game 's
i 'm grateful that they were actually getting at the idea that they 're going to do what do you .
i 'm grateful that they are sitting in , despite security 's trouble , and i 'm extremely grateful that i had to be part of it .
and of course , these people are also changing who they were .
i said , well , i 've talked about a lot of people who were talking about , and again i showed that it 's good to be doing .
and i do it in the way i 'm going to get it .
and i thank you .
come with us in prison .
each of you have something we can need .
whether they were an online to the eye of their eye , whether they come to us and get us to come to us if they 're in the context of a financial support .
whether you want to wear our program into a new program , a trick issue .
do you want to talk to us please .
martin anderson and i are here today .
and so look at us for the conversation with them .
thank you .
so i have a deal with me with the eye with the palm with the palm with the 1950s behind the tree .
in a time i was a quiet deal .
you do that , and you make these things .
you can do it for a game .
you go to the interview .
one of the electron in the field of the nervous system .
there are really many ways today like you can use with your muscles process .
the other thing you can do your own point you can use your way around .
anyway , i was also happy with that .
with my work and so on the way , i 'm doing some little with the eye .
so what has i really have to talk to talk about here .
and not just problems .
my problem was to be able to be able to be in a very , and i was right to my life , 30 20 years , 30 years , 30 years , 30 20 years .
it was a revolutionary .
and i found that foundation , i found scary .
to paint it to war .
i was basically living by the time i had a musical trick .
we 're in charge of private .
i just knew what the game path go away ?
do you just get me wrong ?
or what would i do to do the stick back to my eye ?
and look what happened .
what then on me , i know , waiting .
that was the idea of the thought .
i was in this very time with a island .
i 'm going to go through it .
the trick was also even amazed at the absolute failure .
you are in charge of the world , you know , it 's a very , very good place and it 's putting them into a very , very eye way .
but the way of course , i 've got a very , very poor countries .
developing countries where very safe , safe , would be to say than a different interaction with some eye of people who , although they do n't have anything , they 're lucky and joy .
and exactly of those images and wireless lives , it lives in a way too well .
and that was for me to be the while for me to be the while .
i was the thing i was doing .
you face .
and also , i found a bit about a while about a country that i did n't really know .
i wanted to change that .
i wanted to see it right , and i wanted to say , i wanted to say , in fact .
the answer to be a paper , can be to write a paper .
and to be interested in the personal personal interest .
how do you know countries better ?
by using people , it 's by looking at it .
the people are living with you home .
not in the hotel .
by doing the challenges and with the problems of people .
and by doing the people 's working with people .
at least this , that 's the answer i could give me to this question .
and i wanted to make that .
and also , i wanted to make something a little bit .
i wanted to afford a character .
good thing .
and that feeling was , in fact , to me , i 'm still growing up with a eye game .
i was so many times in love with the company just has been pretty touched .
there was a 3,000 older civil war that not only come in many thousand , but also many economic and social problems .
with a meter of an industrial income rate of the food magazine , is linear , the poorest country in asia .
and the hard thing is going to continue to be one of the world 's most poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below poverty .
almost an fifth of the population is suffering on malnutrition .
forty percent of the adults ca n't read and write out of the adults .
so all of these facts are very much different kinds of personal stories and science that i met on this journey of time i met in a while where i was ready and open with change .
i wanted to change something else .
and it was also interested in my head from the company came from the company .
i quit my job .
and they give me with aid .
and i 'm now playing a little bit of an example of the answer that i received on my mind .
because it 's just a big feel of a sense of mind .
it 's a serious desire at a serious international system of international , making up businesses .
and not to make a eye there 's an eye for a eye that 's going to live in your way in the company and it 's looking for a sense of her back .
hello ?
am you all going ?
i was really serious about really serious and good .
at least , i thought .
and this answer was a online game .
i was really fast .
and of course , a fairly emotional answer is written on .
and fortunately , happiness , would never have no sense of military language .
instead , i took up pretty much an amazing feeling about what good feedback did .
i used it as an motor to make my own business to the form .
marcus .
sebastian betti like video operations and national power systems .
a company basically actually what i was looking at was the back .
and that 's the possibility of a country 's different ,
the possibility of resistance makes really challenging .
by using , by the people in the place , live in place , work .
and that 's not a way somewhere can work somewhere , but in the long-term game .
you can start to go by the way by the way in two words .
so , around and turn .
that means so much like the place that you can do with you are doing a good thing .
you can do a good thing .
that sounds a little bit about all the time .
it is not .
there 's a social business business now .
we use more powerful to tools as a tool for sustainable development .
but today , we use a lot of time to do it as a tool for sustainable development .
so , you 're going to go , you know , loving and gas .
because the people who are very much useful to take their back to the car .
you pay for your journey , like the other thing .
but they travel different .
you live in the eye .
and the principle principle is not even a lot of food or good at sustainability .
social security .
it 's design .
and our participants are actually getting out of communication and interests in different projects .
we can put our work to a serious device in those things who would not have a chance to be the classic chance .
because just the underlying infrastructure of it 's not .
to the other , we can increase sustainable projects .
we can pay on their own sustainable projects and food .
so we 're eating a hundred percent of the same things .
they 're not running on the phone .
and that 's all for our long , environmental engagement of meaning .
now we started to have a work with our work with the deserts .
and this was like , like , for instance , we have our engagement on uganda .
and then after four years i 've now had married and my husband and i also are a team for a trick .
so let 's go on the stick away ?
or what would be even bigger ?
if we 're going to go further further ?
if we do n't just have to do with social engagement and sustainable travel , in his own language ?
and so the individual effort in charge ?
i 've even seen things in the world 's life .
so that 's basically a new company , in fact .
a company that goes on companies .
but with other people with other philosophy , like the ones ,
would we want to do that ?
it was the next question .
now , in the sun , new companies ?
and certainly , let 's have sure .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're in an area .
because we 're talking about the same language .
because we dream the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we 've given a sister in this year .
marcus .
and with the end of energy companies , we are able to be on their development and the medical eye we 're going to support people through a great human development .
and we 'll be part of the participants , and entrepreneurs or employees of creative companies with individual development development .
so , the personal social and the will are actually completed .
and they can turn out the eye .
there 's done again again .
a typical of those can be a very stick to one of the action to a different eye game .
he shows you a short time where you 're where you 're in , or where you 're in .
where you might have even more even the same still .
where you might be too , where you might think too little , and in fact , in thinking .
and he shows one that you 're right to be good .
leads to the point his strength do .
it 's the creativity of all the sudden , suddenly .
or is it found the hackers in the way that you discovered it .
the fbi things do n't want to change it .
and the force , things to change , can change it .
and you can do a lot of change .
already very short and have been at it .
we know that .
one example of that .
these are some resources now has made invisible skills , and they 're called and the end game .
this is five very wonderful women from uganda .
it 's been sad hospital and talent .
it 's beautiful , beautiful , i 'm going to go through a great time ,
and i 've been talking there for years .
because it 's simply not a market for them .
because they do n't know how they can improve the quality .
because nobody 's said that , which might be a matter of fact .
we wanted to help these women .
and therefore , have a trick in the year as well .
you 're doing married safety .
products get the people out of poverty .
they give them income .
a future .
we went to be live with our eye live live .
and we start with a social eye .
a trick of thousand of a thousand people are from women .
the marketing will not only get them for a $ income .
but to make it also allow a much more bigger .
this first a sudden is actually social and turning social hair and go in one .
so who wants to support the way of this , to get a more a more more a more more a more more a more time , which is to take us right with the project .
he can travel into the women and then the women , and then the women can go into the women .
in the very , very long , we do n't want to give a five work to give them a work on 50 women or a hundred .
and it 's not just in uganda , but also in gas and in other order , where we work with that tissue .
but just a project from our collective cycle of projects .
we work in all of the central areas .
and health and health and turn , rise .
because the work in just just not to do in just .
what happens to the kids when women work ?
right .
so in this year , we started in nepal and in uganda , we 've started two online gas gas .
everything is going to be in our level .
and the whole power still make sense than any single project 's project .
now , we 're able to actually see we 've ever seen for entrepreneurs in the different projects .
and the very thing that you do is , you know , you just do n't want to get a lot of ways back in a common space .
and finally , i would like to end up here on a journey .
and so , i do n't like you to finish the eyes .
you are , you 're in africa .
rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on the board of your board .
and are really happy , and i 'm going to be sick .
you 've just had to have the farm right right now .
there were a while there .
marcus .
tasty .
the walls are , are more difficult .
there 's a very profound way of flying down here .
you 're looking out of the window .
and i think kids in the face , they 're in the eye .
its eye cover in the front of the sand .
you 're on your eye .
and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a thin layer of your eye is on the
you laugh the children .
you 're much names .
you 're going to make you just call you the game anymore .
marcus .
you do n't know how it was .
but soon you get to go .
and the ones on which they were closed , they 're doing the kids .
at the end of the street , a huge tree is a huge tree .
you 're going to meet you with your mind .
in the amazon 's line , in the course of the tree , is in the course of the tree , you 're going to address the new designs of the new design of the eye .
you get to talk to your hands and day , you know .
later , the other women come to the other women .
they smile in the eye .
until your english boxes .
below the tree .
open .
so incredible is that there 's an amazing internet here .
tomorrow is going to the morning .
you 'll see it .
the exchange is an valuable valuable .
it 's also nice to talk back to that again .
you know , the song .
and you 're listening to track .
mom 's professional groups will ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever .
you 're singing an african song .
you 're working and happy .
you can go back to the eyes again .
now , everybody from us can make the ability to meet it on something new .
or at least , for one short time , i would send you to throw a little bit more well .
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i start , if i just care about them today , i are here you 're in , already someone in house house .
i do n't look at the light that i do n't do right , but then someone wants to pass her .
here we go down here .
two .
i do n't know what it does n't know , but in every case there there 's two , that 's beautiful , we 're already able to do it .
i mean , i mean , there 's a building in the building also , and that was the high mountain mountain in the east of the city .
that 's the building .
together with the age of 20 people , i 've been the fact that i was in the last summer , i think , in the last summer , i think , in the last summer , live in the last summer .
and so , pretty careful , i just got to you today .
well , just like some of you .
what should it do ?
there 's an lot of there to this . a lot of them .
but i want to explain that briefly .
oh , what do you sit to do so now ?
and you 're going to do the park , like , in the park , or how ?
only a small choice of questions that works us , friends and friends have been experienced me to be part of a student that i think of them , they 're something that i 'm names .
and everybody felt that we had the ones who have a lot of the eye .
and here are a lot of the applications that have built with the eye and rubber size .
and to calculate against the magic of these traditions .
but who knows , this is not my type of the favorite type of fire .
and it was n't the presence of the kitchen .
what we see here is a sign from the eye in the game .
this is a public space that is being private , and therefore for many people , i do n't have to say , i do n't say , but in public hand , and therefore , not as a , of course , how you can use public spaces
we were a group of online that we put in the desire with to the desire to be able to go into the way of rocks , to be sustainable and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell a different trick .
we were a community team , and this has to see now is now , because it was a very serious team .
from the areas of architecture , by architecture , social social -- politics politics -- and the skills of sharing , to be the music , the music is laughing , and mountain photography , and wind .
of course , at different and same social cultural cultural and personal scales .
our analogy are so and , we see , `` well , '' that is a way we 're doing it .
and they 're allowed to be done in different skills , but also we 've also been on different networks .
and creative and creative technology solutions in the eye that we then did , to know ?
we actually have been able to make an standard of the milky ones .
however , we were about to think of the papers with stories and ideas .
we 've asked memories and images .
and from these memories and images , they tried to develop the potential analogy for the milky way .
and it was important to us that the process is always low .
we 're always always going to have taken up as a specific platform and the eye system .
so , as a clever thing , as a simple and an enemy and the enemy , it was and after a interview .
on the experience we have done , i 'll go to the evening today .
every city has a game in places .
the one of the neighborhood give a face .
and in many cases , this is the bad thing , and it became bad and become able to do and see in the context of the citizens as a nuclear places .
they are the dead places of a city because they do n't often have a lot to what we would expect to be in a public space .
so for example , we have to be able to make it go .
and this , but also , the city of the city places , are going to be a lot of ways of that .
and the brain , they want to be able to do their places , often very often remain interested in their own own .
what has it with me , i like to ask some questions , right here in a few outside .
i mean , a lot .
and this kind of places gives us not just a face of our city .
no .
they 're the social places of our city in which our social lives is happening .
so , we 're often going to get the first one at the first time we can make the game between our neighbors , if we just meet ourselves on the way to the building .
and can that that would be if we just have a trained opportunity to sit and sit , and in fact , to stop us when the spaces are designed by the way we 're getting equal .
and we just finished the internet industry .
and we sometimes get some kinds of skills from these kinds of stuff , sometimes .
but what happens to be a sense of community .
the more i have more more more more in this kind of space , the faster room , and the more things are going to get into the field of this community .
and if i do n't go to you , what you might be a single call of the size .
we were then in front of two challenges .
we can start with the citizens of the consciousness , responsibility and commitment for their neighborhood , or to do with the end of the eye .
how can be used by a given of a child ?
how can be in ideas that are being transformed ?
and i 'm against the windows against the windows and the head of places that are now as the ones to do , and it 's not going to make the same places in the same places .
imagine now you 're sitting here , once you put up the newspaper and read your text .
so love and citizens , we 're going to get them to give them three of these things to three of the eye for the same eye of the eye that designed a while of the eye there .
they 're not allowed to the idea of a option idea .
and the key thing with the most people is going to do with most of you is going to be cut out of the most one .
they 're going to go ?
would anybody get to go from that event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds like great .
there were used to make what is going to be meant .
you can be able to make yourself the question that looks in the future .
and as i 'm said , sounds that sounds great in the first moment .
but i 'm trying to get myself at a explanation .
and because i think they ca n't really be really really a really heavy or choose or high , do n't get away .
one because of course , is a lot of time , is far too late to do .
that means , mostly , you do n't have any opportunity to make your really specific skills or to say , there were actually a design , and you can not be able to do it yet whether you 're going to the urban green green
or , like a friend of friend recently said , the color have the soldier for example .
second explanation is rarely catch from information and memory .
think about the three laughs .
we are here what we want to show them , and you can keep them out .
in frustration , often , the consequences are the consequences which i think of the end of the world .
i 'm not like to do a decision about the eye or the eye of the time , if i was going to have ever been able to go back to the way there .
it 's also different .
although we have the instructions of the price to have many conversations , we 've been at least more sophisticated , eventually .
and we took these experiences , and they 're now who i want to share for other people .
i want to get it to other projects on other projects , but also , or , or , or , of course , in the city city city , and to politics .
because in the fact that , the people are , the way that they should be doing is actually really attention , and they 're actually responsible for these processes .
if that really is really interested in a toy map , as it often is so often , and then we 're going to need , and then we need to get the incentive to make new eye in the way .
i also said not to say the end of the time , but i also all sitting with you today , in this place .
and that 's because i think i 'm important to really .
i 'm asking it for important to be , and i go , and i want to encourage you with our example of the way another opportunity to give you a chance .
and i 'm all looking at them because they are the ones who can be able to be able to be able to be able to be in an fashion .
so we have to look like the weather look at the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and commitment for their neighborhood and public services , at the end ?
first of all , it 's going to be a focus on a dialogue .
in the end of ways , sustainability in ways to go into a game and different interests .
what we see here is a world project that we invited to do .
what we see here are a bit of the eye and conservation disease in the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all this talk on a lot of time in a lot of time , so not the presence of the things , or the presence of the people are about the skills of the citizens .
the citizens in the place are experts , they are experts for their neighborhood know what 's missing to them , which is the ones connect with a place in which tradition is using a place , and also they need what 's missing them to them .
the eye , especially , especially in the city can go in terms of the way that we can take it to the game .
in the pacific , or in a special case , the other system can be involved in the order that just will take on the project , the one of the business is the time .
all this leads to make this where all information is available for all information , and then the place can be accurate .
by being able to get involved too , that 's a terrible place to the place .
and for a dialogue , it means that the audience actually turned to be seriously , really seriously .
and then , if somebody says , i want to get a stick to the center .
and of course , it can be a complete family , but the goal to be in the game , is what 's going on with everybody , which is the right solution , and perhaps in the turn , and then , in the turn , maybe in
so , as i said , this has to be put out of this about this .
second , many people are now fighting here .
our eye is covered .
one is a way that they can be in front of the other group in front of all .
one of the other can write good , but then the text does n't talk to a big group .
another one might be a little bit if you 're going to be shot or down .
or building your ideas in a eye .
what i want to say is to make a different eye to be able to be accurate .
we have an opportunity to come up here , and we just get to come to it , just watch what happens .
in the background , small show would have little show .
what we 've got here is to give you the possibility to give you a game game .
we 've had the possibility to paint .
we 've had the possibility to write to write writing .
number of the age .
this was a game girl .
we had the opportunity to be able to play our ideas with their teachers playing ideas .
the possibility , outside of the eye , is that , we should be there , should be given .
for example , for example , for example , a trick , can be about the trick about with you are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
the consumer and the most powerful members of the results that the results can make this is the dialogue under the game game .
we 're going to have the entire process on facebook and on one of the brain , and at the same blog , is some good samples over a beach .
our third to the point .
you might remember , i told me that there 's often too late to be late .
in my most i have a event , there were three sides of the eye .
so the process is when it was very , very high and the sentences in the most difficult self , the surgeon were n't even able to know what to do is to happen to the power of a place .
and when it 's coming out of the dialogue , i 'm going to be thinking about this to point back with one point , what i 'm going to do is that i think that 's what the natural race to be a area .
by the way , the trick itself is going .
and then , if not in the beginning , it 's so like the poor event and so forth , but it 's so forth , but on the experience of the previous experience .
what happens when citizens put up their city and get their city .
it 's already seeing you on a projects that 's happening .
i 'm here to be a example of a eye here , which is the trick , is probably known in many many here .
in new york , just a project has been launched , and we go about a trick .
in the meantime , there 's six weeks together in six weeks , there are been all together to make that feel possible or the end of the eye .
the time has written the policy policy written at least not to make the idea to their own .
and also the presence in new york , i 'm not going to say that i do n't have to say , because he 's become one of the most important to the city , was n't an idea of politics or a government .
in the opposite , the eye for the game were already found for the game .
so we go back in germany , we have the citizens already already , you know , we would think of a test , or again , to the citizens .
the city had been told at the time , `` well , '' that 's not a need .
the four weeks of the ones we have with the food that are totally totally coming to the food .
today , the presence of the city is coming off .
while the site is going to become a result , it works right , and the city that works and the presence that they were there , and they were being able to stay out other to the end of others .
the industrial railway distribution their own talk on the street .
in fact , in fact , a trick of an eye came .
all right , so you want to say to you .
now let 's just keep going on that .
but i think it 's wrong for the city of responsibility .
why ?
for one , because you should have a look for it , or should have .
while it was more forward , citizens 's citizens are going to focus on the rule for you in any form of scientific scientific form of projects that are also responsibility for projects that are also on the edge of attention .
and then , for other , you know , when the city has done projects , other are the same means to use .
a online initiative , this only is called the cover of the tree .
and the goal was , by the way , was a commercial student who was coming on the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end
the language was a food election , the battery bought in january .
there 's still a lot of time there .
and we 've seen , `` unfortunately , the problem is that we could n't even do the responsibility .
but we 're now at each case , that when the city are successful in the field of the field of the field of the time , if they actually actually succeed , that then is going to be a trick .
and that 's where we 're happening to happen to be open , though .
and to finally end up , i believe many projects that are developed to their importance , complexity or their cost of the city , have to have a chance to create happiness and more awful .
if you just get in time in time and get to your focus by the citizens .
in a way , the city and citizens .
in the other , the city and you all have here sitting here .
if we say our own voices , and the same thing that the quality of the people do n't perceive the power as a more more than a more more than a more more more longer than a matter of a matter .
that 's it .
yesterday , the main duck after the street day , we were in love with this in the front of the time and they get to the interview .
we 've talked about it over the cotton .
so this idea that this idea , again , did have yet did a chance of being able if it has no longer deal in this life , just a chance , a chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , but relatively quickly , there are two things that we do n't experience .
one is the photoshop for iraq .
and the second thing was , i was right there , was the table at the table at school , right now ?
no .
no .
school , some of you may remember out the same in the same .
and i 'm like that , now we 're now close to now , but the words are going to lead to me with the story of me immediately .
my neck spent together and i just want to go back on this one .
and i do n't know how to you , but i was who was going to put that the one who she took seriously that was always going to me next .
i do n't know what 's got in the process .
you will understand it , you know , my school was n't beautiful , and after i had my last eye with me was n't clear , he never had to school .
and what should i do is i take up when i take up the most beautiful days i 've spent there , i 've spent [ you like that .
big desire and totally struggle .
how did it it be caught ?
how could this happen ?
that 's what i started talking about , that something happened , which i could n't afford to be honest at all .
i got kids .
so my wife got the children .
and so , in that , it was also clear that she had one that is to take the eye .
and to it , one day , it said , `` honey , '' it 's like that .
you 're going to go and leave you today .
yeah .
and i went to the door and then i was sitting there in the eye and i sat , i felt myself in the eye .
that 's how it looked at us at that time .
and the building industry also as school was designed at the time , and i get to call , and i do , to be a wonderful thing .
and when i heard the teacher , i heard , and you know , kids do n't learn for school , but for the reason i live , i mean , oh my god , i did n't get the back .
what is this that we made out of school from this school in which life really did live ?
so many of us have a really good deal of there .
where do you actually have a good deal in your life ?
and perhaps some times , the capital capital is that you know .
what 's more optimistic now ?
now , you 're doing this very short time in a very short time , so far , you know , so i can go to the nice again , to go to it , being bad ?
well , i 've got to be the time to get the interview , but otherwise ?
and what does a really point that says , `` you know , '' is someone to do a good doctor ?
whether it 's an objective and whether the good personal properties has ?
no .
so , actually , you can actually learn for it , not for school , we learn .
if we went back as a back , so about years , there may be been the end of the program .
that 's time in germany in germany , the game at the end of the time then they had been introduced in the end of the time .
and where we have , as we 're now , has its roots .
and if we think of the time back , it was actually so people did n't have access to know their time .
and there was this four or six years , who they were forced to go to school and be able to have the knowledge , then the only way they had to do to know and the facts and the information of their time .
today , a trick in its pocket than the largest half of the time the day of the day .
and the national century , that was the time of the being , right ?
that means that there 's a lot of changes in the world , and then people have needed to have these new machines .
but at the same time , people needed to wait these machines and fix them .
and we needed people who are able to build these machines , and then , these factories are going to the outside .
you might recognize it .
the eye system that we 're still now have in germany today , in germany , in the time , in that time .
and there 's probably a sense of mind .
and , because i really have been so , you know , what i learned in school is about his head to work , which i was going on , who 's at the top who stood in the edge , which was long .
so we look at the future .
let 's do the noise on the century where it 's , and we 're looking at the year of alzheimer 's .
the year is there , the first step was just about to rape before .
i was finished my research and i thought , right now , now you are now giving you here , the first company .
yes , after a couple of things i look around the internet , i then go to the internet , i 've also got this one .
and some of the companies are now and they 've been getting bigger and bigger , and we 're so slowly , and some of the companies then are like to get in free to free care .
you always see two times in life .
and we then had 30 years after 30 employees after this .
so , we had a beautiful growth that we were doing , and we had such interesting jobs like the eye there , the game themselves .
i do n't know if they were able to have some real visual idea , what do these people do , but when i was in school , we had no idea that it would ever give this .
even when i was a trick , i was not like the internet ever talk .
and the kids that we send in the school are what they are going to do , for 10 , four , 20 or 30 years , are 30 years , or 30 years , in ?
the only honest answer is we have no idea .
and what 's the knowledge of which facts are you going to need to be successful in those future jobs ?
and if you 're honest , there 's the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're in a series of who who could see me give me the eye for the most eye .
there are some online call , which read about that .
well , see , you have no idea .
how do we get what you can get out to be in school life ?
what are the things that we need to do to save children to save children for them to them ?
and perhaps help help a look at it , what companies are looking at today .
these are the presence of school , yes ?
the students from schools and universities , then , then come into the company .
and if you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
so there 's the most yes , so these guys then do , we 're looking at it , we 're doing a result of the 10 years , and 12 years of time in canada .
that 's going to be used to school and also do n't afford it in the future .
but what might be done with school , but maybe the things that are always going to be important is the ones that are doing is so that these are the hard eye game will be hard to the future .
and you can put it up in three groups of principle .
this , businesses want to have forgotten , the mechanical ones , so they 're the size of that .
almost all of the things that we 're talking about almost all the companies who think too .
and then these companies are coming out , and are the ones .
so we think more and thinking what we think of and forth .
let 's start with the equator .
that 's relatively fast to get .
if we look at the world 's way today works , how fast does it work , how fast is changing .
so , yes , we 're asked all the models that 's going to be used from the internet from today .
i 'm being doing that practice that i have to do with this change .
i 'm being doing that practice that are creative .
i 'm being doing the staff that are the ones .
this is pretty much exactly the opposite of what the factory was needed from the factory century century .
the second issue is relatively clear ,
it 's about responsibility .
there 's about people that are going to take responsibility .
first of all , for your own life .
but also it , the big scale .
whether the company is now , we 're just so for a society for a big responsibility .
and the third factor , the air industry , they are almost the most common dimension .
and if we remember the best network , there 's the internet in the internet .
argentina has a crime system has the right industry , and germany has a team .
it was n't a match in the eye who won the size .
that could only do in common .
and so someone , that large , the big canyon of our time , steve jobs , yes .
it was n't the one that invented the iphone , which did n't invent the vote who did n't invented in an who , who did n't have any of it .
the team had made this possible , because just as a team , that could create this what they were done .
so school , that could bring those three things that the year were in the way that we were going to live in it .
but there are a result of fourth , and that 's almost more important .
and that 's learning itself .
if the only thing we can say is that they 're actually saying that they 're actually going to be effective about , but this is going to learn more and more new and fun to get the number for the number that we 're successful in love ,
the one thing was to come out of the people who were calling these things .
but where did i have ?
i was sitting in this interview , and the kids who have the kids , who know that it 's not even the same thing that you need to pay for you .
so after that that was how i had an argument for the screen , they do n't yet say from any .
so , to the point where online , then all of all , are all invisible .
yes , i was sitting there , and what i should say , when you 're the eye of my kids , these are still the event .
less fun was to be my dad when the stress of the homework was about his mind and learning the entire friends .
and even fun , if the kid gets sick , because in the school , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
and finally , this is the eye , or was a peak of the eye at that school , and then the end of these school was as well .
it was also not a trick ; it was a trick , so the last hour , and in fact , we were the only parents that were invited to be invited .
and i 'm now saying to you , and i 'm also the details by the details that i 'm going to see , and i think we have to give our child there , that 's not going to be right .
but the way is that two years we 've been saying , because it does n't work .
what do we do wrong ?
and we actually had the question of being broken ?
and are we the only ones that 's going to go ?
i 've been talking about `` two years ago , and i realized , i saw a lot of people , '' and i realized , i actually realized that you 're just alone .
there are many , which is all very similar to it , and that was two years ago , and we sat with the eye , and we 're just working with a new company , we 've been thinking of where we can get us to the street
and what do i want to say , he almost got me the same story with one of his kids , he almost found the same thing , and we have been so lucky that we could actually get our children out there , yes ?
in berlin there are used to different schools and we could even grow in places .
but can that everyone in any everyone out there ?
and somehow to just not want to get our children to get in security and then there was that way there as they 're out .
and after we both have the sense , we have n't think about that as well , but we have good , we 're the first to have the first thing to do this time .
just how do we change anything anything ?
the good news is that we 're able to be able to be able to us .
we 're not alone .
but we 've found relatively quickly about very quickly , very quickly , we found what kind of wanted us to do , which were to come out of school that all sweet is being correct .
it 's not that the children and their parents are under the suffering that happens a lot of time on it .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of teachers have the teachers .
if we look at how the number of that we have changed in the last 10 years has been doubled .
can it be now that all parents who wrong ?
that all of the children are broken , and that are also the teachers ?
or can we be a school school , which does n't seem to be like this , so that 's what you do is that you 're going to do this with this eye of it , that simply does n't seem to be right .
and we 've found many people who went similar and we were found people who have not had children who did not have children .
and they understood that they need to take responsibility for the future that they have to take responsibility for the future by taking responsibility for what we were in our children and the children who are going to go to school , with the way ,
and we 've got to change the second , there were a whole range of amazing to school , and there are there in schools , here and there really , and there 's almost a school teacher that are really a living experience , and there 's
and there 's even the one or other people 's line in the first time , and then that 's going to be able to go to the first step .
and how should we help ourselves as a game ?
we had no idea that there we could be about help .
but we can do one of the schools , and we can go into these schools and we can be able to put people into these schools , to school , so the parents who are , the teacher and the students , and we can move with those
so there are people together who worked in , rather than any of these things , and learning and learning in two days , and learning how it means to work .
so , these are all very concrete challenge that they 're in common .
and after two as i would have been able to do , new eye has developed or evolved to the death of the bus , there were some new school to have been some new high school as we had some of the school .
or they have some basic sense of how to know how to know how to do that , they developed them .
within two days of all , we developed a while of the next day immediately will be broken away .
but what happened in these two days of these two days , and that does this really me so much more my little old , which i 'm going to be in , i would be spending in schools in all germany , this energy that are actually learning
and if you experience three things together , what do you think like the muscle category .
so , sort of things , in and think of it , when they 're going to experience as a team .
so this is a little bit of a little bit , the arts .
and if we just get four weeks of that , if you were to get out of that were in that period of school , we 'll then know that there has been a whole deal of school , change change that there 's been built new culture .
and that 's incredibly hot hot .
and i get to think of school to think of school .
i would have taught school to think about school .
and i 'm also also very talking about how to talk about being talking about school .
talk about what you might like to talk about what you 're not like .
you will be surprised to be how much of them come out and how many people get the same thing , but just not talk about it .
let us bring every single school in germany to the face .
let 's change the whole education system .
and let 's do this together with people with the school day and to see parents , the teacher and students .
because we can do together in common .
thank you .
