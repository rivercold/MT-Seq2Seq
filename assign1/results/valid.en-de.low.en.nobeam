you know , one of the big eye in travel , and one of the desire to travel with research , in the presence of the way in the presence , with people who are still asking on the old days , and they feel like they feel the
just the knowledge still still get beyond the way that the milky way is , or the meaning of the world 's up world is full of meaning , or that in the context , the way the will follow the breath is the idea of the way that
and of course we are able to get the same ones that go out .
we 're all born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through the face .
we need to tell ourselves by the time by death , and so we should not surprise us that we all sing and make them dance and art .
but what 's interesting is that is the unique internet rainforest of the consumer group , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it does n't matter whether it 's about the eye in the forests of plastic matter or the windows in haiti , the eye in the field , or a eye in the 20th time , or even a trick in the world ,
and all of these people teach us that there are other people who are going to be some ways of thinking of other ways other ways of what we found on the earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , one of hope .
the tumor cultures , the world 's web cultures , a net of the web and virtual life that 's the earth and it 's just important to earth , like the biological ones that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural eye game , the air rate of all the thoughts and dreams , as dreams , comedy and the plants that have been built by human imagination since the world 's history has come to .
the eye is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's a symbol of what we are , and we 're as amazing as amazing species , we know .
and just as the biosphere became the very strong strong , it did n't know that with the eye -- just to any larger speed .
no square a monkey would say to be that for example , that 50 of the species or more of all species in the kitchen of the kitchen , because it 's just not right right right now , and yet this -- the online eye in biological diversity
and the key part is the middle of languages .
so when each of you were born in this room , we 've talked about the earth 's massive languages .
now , it 's a language only just the number of infection or a series of the eye .
language is a expression of the human mind .
it 's a means that the soul of the soul is going to find access to the material world .
every language is like a game of the mind , a thought of a thought , an ecosystem 's mental possibilities .
and from these high languages , we 're going to sit here in monterey , and half the half of them are n't in the ears , in the ears , in the ears .
you 're not going to be learning , that 's the thing , if nothing is going to happen , you 're actually dead .
what could be a great deal to do from the late `` the last theater '' to be to be the one language to have a possibility , to be able to feel the hope of the ancestors , or to expect the hope ?
and yet , you know , you get this terrible destiny in fact , somewhere in the earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , every two weeks , the last is the last eye of an old language with the molecules .
and i know some of you say that , `` is n't it better to me ? '' about the world , do n't you want to be a better place if we all only going to talk to the language ? '' and i say , `` oh
let 's be your mouths . ''
and then suddenly they can see what it would be like if they could do their own language .
so i want to talk to you a journey of a journey through the time , a short journey , with the way to try to try to make them respond to you , which was actually lost .
now , there 's some of us that we have forgotten when i say , `` different opportunities to the mouth of being '' to be different possibilities .
take this child in the middle of the southern amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they 're doing the presence of the east from the forest of apollo 's recovery .
this is a people which not invented the color between the color of blue and green , because that 's the end of the forest , that people are on , the eye is
you have a more intelligent language , and you call the primitive security face called , you have to marry someone who talks another language .
all of this is the most recent past , the gap in these big houses , where the majority of six or seven languages are talking , is that you never hear somebody who is learning to be a language .
they 're listening to talk and talk to speak .
or , one of the most famous tribes i 've ever lived , the eye in the house , a amazing people , the first one in the year of the year of being a year .
in the year of japan , five brothers contact and made a great mistake .
they were flying sophisticated pictures of air , and what we would like to do as was the very bad thing , and then we decided that these people from the rainforest has yet had never seen any other things .
they 're turning these photographs from the forest floor , and tried to see the face or the character , did n't find this , and very familiar to see that this is in the dna and then you could increase the five brothers with the dna .
but the poor of the eye were not just outside of the outside of the way of the production .
they 're doing each other .
now , the typical of the deaths had happened by the deaths .
we started back to the presence of eight generations of , and we found two cases of the natural death , and when we 're now the people who became a nuclear deal of , they were become a world that was being so old , that he died
but at the same time , they had a clear fan of the forest that was amazing .
their civil civil rights could have the roofs of a animal from 40 feet of 40 , and to determine what the species of this was .
the early at the early end of years , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me , whether i was interested in haiti and the secret societies , the foundation of the strength of the food and the foundation that were used to make sure
to give this a sense of having a sense of a sense of , of course , something about these remarkable faith and dolphins is not going to be the same window of the black magic .
in the opposite , it 's really important by doing a complex species of action .
it 's interesting .
if i would ask you to ask the big economy , what would they say ?
th , islam , leo , is the same thing , and whatever .
a continent always left left because the rare rate was n't that you have no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course , there 's an idea of the very common religious thought of religious religious times that during the motor 's motor built in the eye
but what 's so interesting is that that live relationship between living and dead .
the living gave the script .
the indus script , you 're going to become in the big , big water , the answers to the rhythm of the dance to map the soul of the living room , so that the game is going to be in god 's god .
so , they 're like to say that the game likes to be , `` you know , you go to church and you like to god .
we dance in the tracks and become god 's god . ''
and because , they 're obsessed , you are going to reach off the spirit . how can you be being being being being being done ?
you see this amazing joke : you 're in a 3d store building , and you see , you know , that 's black coal without a astonishing , amazing one , amazing version of the ability of the ability of the mind that the body of the mind
now , from all the people i met , they were the fbi 's memory , from the sierra santa mountain eye in the eye , the most powerful .
so from the old eye civilization , the presence of the eye are diagnosed from working on columbia side of the field , in this direction of the people in the local level of building water , and the presence of the people were a lot of high ,
in a eye continent , these people were never been paid by the eye .
now , until today , today , you 're going to look from a plate of a plate of a bowl of wood . the training education , but the education is very extraordinary .
the young is going to the age of three and four years from her families and in a eye of black black , where the average of the glacier is on the age of 18 , and two times of the glacier of every nine years , and i
and during this whole time , you 're used to get into the values of your society , values that keep your mind your liver and only , just your email , the most cosmic -- or we could say the green -- to keep the
at the end of this amazing neighborhood , you 're all of a sudden you go out outside , in your life , at the age of 18 , you see a one , and in this moment of the first time of consciousness , when the sun is
it 's wonderful . you must protect it . ''
they call the older brothers , and they call it that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now , the level of that is going to very important .
and once we think about something and landscape we 're either thinking to you and give the old president of the great prize wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild
so , some other , some things , are not a resource , nor are still going to be your neighbor 's disease .
it does n't have a lot of place in the eye or the cold effect of bus , but yet , in time and the world 's a , of a powerful time , not a very powerful game of the world , but on a very , very
now , what does that mean ?
it means a little child from the rubber field that believe that the mountain is a trick , that the mountain is a trick , which is his or her own destiny , is a whole different person , a little child , in the age that a mountain
whether he 's a member of a mind or a bunch of eye , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor is the metaphor which is going to the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of the golden rule and believed that these forests are there to be able to be able to go .
this is what it made me to another people like my friends under the eye , who believe that these forests of the head of the eye and the computer is the open to the eye , the most online , the
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different features , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like that plant .
it 's a picture i only touched the last last year in the middle of the amazon .
this is the computer model , which has you heard the potential to the potential of these things , the powerful basic goods from the definition of the ocean .
what is so fascinating so fascinating is not just that that is a result , but its eye system , it 's a little different energy system that is actually coming to a series of the eye , the eye , and the eye on smoke , it 's
these whales have a very strong set of view that are the blood ones , and they are very similar to that .
if you 've seen the eye , how you guys have identify that stuff , this device , which you have from different ways to make yourself in the different ways .
so to actually identify this eye , it 's kind of like from a while , is to take it out of dense tissue , and the highway on a sea of electricity .
it 's not going to be produced in reality , it 's going to be the resolution of reality .
i even got with my professor richard richard , richard t , the man who was a little eye with the magic trade in mexico , about this . i said , you know , you could n't feel this kind of , as a vacuum , there 's
but the thing with the eye is they can not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able through a while in the human being a result , is a very , very well , to be able to be
you can only put in terms of connection with some other chemicals that the dark are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
so fascinating is that the game in the eye are the same place from the way that 's necessary to get the presence , so ask itself .
how can these people from a generation of the world of the young online plants are not using local plants that are when they do n't know that way , a way of `` to make a way of `` so , '' so that they are bigger than
we use this great chinese chinese , and try and mistakes what is going to be done as a research crisis .
but if you ask the indians , she 's like , `` the plant talks to us . ''
so what does that mean ?
this is the tribe that has 17 different property of the sound that you all seem seen in a very large distance in the forest that you may like to come in .
and then you ask them how she 's treated your own fat , and you say , `` i thought you know some of the plants .
i mean , you know nothing , i do n't know , '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that you take every single sign in the world 's disease , and you sing to a different diamond system .
now , this is no idea you do n't get a nuclear bridge in harvard , but it 's a lot of more interesting than you .
now , that the problem is that even the time of us who have been able to do that are the hard race that are capable of the hard way to the hard things of norway and the signs , they 're kind of who 's called the past
so , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , you know , 300 years , you know , for the other century , it 's not all the innovations that we 're saying about , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity either either
all cultures , again , again , again , in the dance with new skills .
and the problem is not the technology .
the game did n't hear less to the sioux when they did n't get a bow and will make the body of any of the americans when the americans were being stopped americans when they were a horse and they 're doing tasks .
not change and technology for some technology to the end of the eye . it 's power , the most basic face of atoms .
and where you 're going to be in the world , you 'll find that these cultures are not the world 's online world , and they 're dynamic , their existence , by the way , they 're in the face , a trick , which is willing
or if we go to the mountains of bus , i take a lot more stable , you 'll see the sound of the political size .
you know , the fourth percent , which is based on human beings , is where they 're being in general , but the trick , the destruction of the people , not just by sure , but in general , they 've become part of one online .
and you can not understand the suffering when you 've experienced it .
i 've been looking at a young colleagues with a young colleagues in a eye , and only when i came up with the face of which i was in the statistics of whom , 1.2 million of them who were turned on the cultural revolution .
and my father was forced that young , as a led point of the eye of the eye .
this meant that he had killed during the chinese four times .
his uncle 's uncle was in the top of her facebook , which people got to rock .
his mother was able to be able to be able to be able to be the crime of the crime .
he was in the age of two years of prison to hide under her the end , because they could n't live with it .
the sister who did n't create these eye , became a trick .
and one day she had a hospital hit on a hospital , and that the eye had to get it for seven years to do it for seven years .
the suffering of suffering can be down , but the game 's mind is something that is something so well .
and at the end , we 're really a choice in the end . if we do in a very eye 's world or in a third show of the diversity of life ?
now , margaret game said before she died that it 's your greatest fear , that as we move to , have been an easy range of human imagination on a eye of thinking , it 's going to be a day from a dream of thinking , and
and it 's based on to think that our species may have been there for the $ 100 species .
the game revolution that got us to the agriculture , and we have an example of the face of the eye , the poetry of the sea through the brain chain and the hierarchy , and the loss of it -- found 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world we know about is an 300 years old .
now , that little story , i do n't tell me that we all have the answers to the challenges that we are in the next way to be in the next way .
if we 're doing this tumor to the importance of people , we call it with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we 're going to be able to take the possibility of what we are : people with a lot of consciousness that are aware that all people have been aware of the importance that all people and they have to be able to get
here 's a picture i took at the northern end of the eye when i went to the eye on the eye , and this man told me a wonderful story of his favorite life .
the holy government of government is not about good with the entropy of entropy , and during the time the game of the world 's essentially , in the universe of our ecosystems , they were forced to move in the sky .
the grandfather ended this old prize prize .
the family who had fear in the fear had had the fear of him took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the aliens have no fear in front of the cold , they used to benefit to their advantage .
the ones were actually made from fish that was thrown in a while .
the grandfather of man was n't playing before the arctic 's night , or the eye .
he starts out at outside , he made his pants down , and he goes in his hand , and when the crowd started to market , he 's got it into the shape of a test test .
he plays his eyes on the side of the eye and when it was completely , and completely , he was completely a dog with it .
he gives a demonstration and a report , the founder of the deep and clean a child , and they took a kid , and the u.s. rate of the eye on the dry eye .
you can do anything something .
and this is in a very symbol for the resistance of the body coast and all across the world in the world .
the holy government gave the civil coast in the u.k. , the complete control of the whole control in the field of this area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it 's our new country and it 's called `` well , ''
it 's just ordinary area . you all get the end together .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , a state , to have the germans to look for his own search and to achieve .
and finally , i think , is quite obvious , at the least of us , who are flying to these kinds of goals of the earth , that they are not removed .
they 're the presence of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination that are on the past times , and all of us , are the dreams of these kids like the dreams of our own children part of hope .
now , what we 're an idea of national economic law is that we believe politicians never never achieve something .
we think that the eye is not a disaster problem , but we think that learning the world is changing , and we probably are probably the best institution for physical health , and our website , we get 35 million
complete countries all the time are sending our language language .
our blueprint , our wife read by millions of read .
and we bring a series of travel in the presence where we take our audience to the people to look at such cultural wonder , that they would say that by the very few , they say that they would be a very little bit of , and you
thank you .
what i first do n't quickly show up as quickly is the basic work , a new technology that we have of microsoft is as a high , right now , in the same morning . and it 's a environment that you can either deal or large and
we see many , many baby of digital level of digital , which you have an analogy and , you know , the kind of thing that you can , and to make any of them out .
and it does n't matter how many information we look at how large these types of are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one is like , for example , a very scan of the skin and it 's in a area of 300 eye .
it does n't matter because the only thing that was the world 's performance of a system like this , the number of people in each moment , also has a very profound architecture .
this is an entire book , an example of the game .
this is the answer from engineering 's house . each other being a chapter .
to prove that it 's really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like this to show that this is a real representation of the eye and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a while .
i would not recommend it .
this is a game case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image , the beginning of a rock image .
and this really , really , to you , and the good experience of the good experience is a real game to read a newspaper , which is a way of media in a media medium .
we also have something at the corner of this particular particular particular particular of the test .
we designed a false village with very high survey that is much higher than a normal one , and we 've added it in an own content .
if you want to see this car on the car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical dancing , or technical school .
and this is really what these ideas are going to be , these things are being put in the business to the shape .
we hope that no longer a family and other people who means more than it should n't be .
of course , the rate of this is a really clear obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really want to spend a lot of time here , except that we 're going to be different .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
so , at the top of nasa , nasa .
let 's now a different thing .
so this is actually live in the web . you can look at it .
this is a project with the name , a bike line , a really , frank name , which really bring these two different technologies together .
one is the right , and the other is a good research about the university of which , a 2010 in the university of the university , under the university of steve is steve with the way steve you .
and rick 's talking about microsoft research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the web . it 's being driven by the eye .
you can see this when we create these kinds of ability where we can train through images and make the experience of time the experience of work .
but the main commitment unit of the pictures is actually the importance .
the ones have taken these pictures together , so they called the real space where these images that are made near the afghan school industry , are they have done here from civil school cells or to make these things
i do n't know exactly whether i 've been in time to show you other environments .
there are what we 're much more sophisticated .
i would love to show you a straight question of math , and this is from a early prototype of electronics who we know in the summer of the summer to show you , what really is n't quite so obvious to the most environment we 've seen on
we had to do it for a nuclear culture . it 's worried about .
this is a ring of the rural evolutionary lady , which is all on the computer with images of flickr , and the only lady is going to be in a black , just , and they 're going to go out images of men in a coma and
so , this is all the things that we are in this way in the different way to each other .
and we can try to try to try to try to move a simple way .
you know , i never believed that i 'm going to work at microsoft .
i 'm very grateful for the scale here .
i suspect you can see these are a lot of different kinds of cameras , and everything is about how to make the eye at a very small place , a pretty large number of them that have been taken by the environment .
and if you can , i will be going to find some of the strange strange .
many of you are visible faces and so
there 's a series of dna sitting there , here you are .
this is actually a poster , of course , lady lady that was named named .
we can actually move from a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environments -- now , from all the social memory of all , how to create it 's going to be the earth going to connected .
all these photographs are connected to each other , and there 's something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes out of the entire earth .
looking at this as the power of narrative security is on virtual earth .
and this is something that complexity , with the people , and it 's growing with the user for the user and it 's going to be bigger .
their own pictures are going to be the ones that have a different person .
if someone did the hard and get all those of the story , they 've been hoping they all are they all become , then my photo is going to be able to come up with all this data , and i can use them as a start to
and of course , the oil of these are the very rich rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that does n't just just do just by doing from institutions and so on the earth , but being doing that , they have become a collective
thank you .
do you understand her ? the software can be able to be able to be in a certain point , within the next few years , all pictures , who are used in the world in the world , are used in principle
yes . she does n't discover anything than it 's about .
if you want to get away down between the images .
and you do this because this is because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the standard of the artistic information , many of these pictures have this way .
so , like you do a eye of pictures , where you might see the sentences and you might look at the text of the website , a lot of information about that that image is .
but what if the picture is it to connect all of your pictures ?
then the range of the artistic is , and the amount that makes you feel , really enormous . it 's a universal trick .
so , that 's really incredible . so , congratulations .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope i 'm going to do other things you 've already heard , and i 'm going to try to make a few connections if you do n't have this
i want to start what i call `` the latest portrait '' ''
the strange thing that we have an little bit of what ?
the strange eye is the most vulnerable of western societies .
an example of an x-ray works : if our goal is the goal of our citizens , it is mostly through the presence of the human freedom .
the reason is , freedom is good in itself , valuable , make sense of creating an eye for human human .
when people have freedom , each of us are about to do things that are actually independent and nobody has to do with us for our own .
the way to maximize is to be a choice .
the more choices have the more choices , the more freedom , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more of the things they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our fossil community , that it would be no longer going to question in real question .
and it 's also a deep deep inside of our life .
i 'm going to give you some examples of what to do modern progress .
this is my supermarket . there 's no big .
i just want to talk about the moment for a minute .
there are 800 eye in my field , if you do n't do the other extra extra extra and 12 times that you could buy about a huge number of jobs in the world 's , which is n't the increase of the store to you .
so that 's what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the local business to go -- `` you know , a trick , radio , radio , up , and in this one morning , there are so many of the people 's license .
we can put millions of different different software systems of view of the brain that are in this one business .
they need to admit that this is a big option .
in other areas , the world of communication .
and there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy , you could have the phone , you wanted to , as long as i was on high bell bell .
you 're going to go out , you have n't there .
a consequence of the evidence was that the phone was n't broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite amount of mobile capacity of mobile , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are mobile phones 's future .
my favorite is in the middle -- the software and the use of oxygen is fighting .
and if you 've seen that until now , you 've seen this up , you can be sure you 're going to get to soon .
and what it does is to walk in the business and to ask this question .
do you see the answer to the question is ?
the answer is no . ''
it 's not possible to buy a mobile phone that does n't happen too much .
in other aspects of life , that are very important than what 's actually buying the same direction of choice , the same explosion of choice .
health -- it 's no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor 's telling you , we could do a job or we could do b .
a one has got to risks and risks .
b has become these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and she says , `` doctor , what do i do ? ''
the doctor says a set has these benefits and risks and b that benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you were , doctor , what would you do ?
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not . ''
and the result is -- we call it `` patient gas . '' and that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the burden of the main design of responsibility for someone 's trying to do -- `` is n't someone 's jobs , '' that
there 's an enormous marketing for social drugs for people like them and i , that , when you think about it , you do n't make sense , because we do n't buy them .
why are you going to be useful by us if we can not buy ?
and the answer is , you do that from us to put the doctor on the next morning , to ask a change for the office morning .
something that works so cool about how our identity is now a question is to be a question of how this slide is supposed to show .
we do n't choose identity , we invent it .
and we 're really trained a lot more as we want to .
so that means that every day when you 're going to go on the morning , you have to decide what 's kind of person to be .
and in terms of marriage and family , there was a time that is when you had a time , almost one and that you could quickly do that kind of like them , and then quickly kids were able to get it
the only choice that are `` who '' and who '' not when , and not what they did .
and today , it 's all too too .
i 'm also also also wonderful intelligent students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that 's not because they 're not smart , and not because they 're less carefully .
it 's because it 's busy things , you 're asking yourself , `` should i want to marry ? i should i marry it ?
should i be able to ? i should n't i have children or did it come in career ? ''
these are all questions .
and you will answer these questions about whether that means all the tasks that i do n't know , and i do n't have to get good at my computer .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to do questions .
work -- we 're as well as being a way to put it out , and technology that make us take every minute from every day from every single time from every place on every place to every place on every place -- the water hotel .
and by the way , there 's a corner i 'm going to tell you about what this is working with .
i 'm not not telling you because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice , we have to make decisions and then again , whether we should work or work or work .
we can play our kids playing the best ones , and we have our phone phone , and our brand to other school , and our laptop is probably on our pockets .
and even if they 're all left , every minute in which we 're asking our child in the eastern test , we 're also asking ourselves , `` should i look at this call ?
should i be the email answers ? should i write that letter ? ''
and even when the answer to the question , `` no , '' there is probably its experience of the experience of your child 's the game , very different than it was .
everywhere we look at , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , live life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived , this was like this .
i want to say that there was some choices , but not all that is a question of choice .
and the world in which we 're going to see life on this .
and the question is , are good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what it is good about , so i 'll be bad about what bad is bad .
all of these experiences have two effects , two negative effects in humans .
it 's an effect of a sense , is that it is silk instead .
so with so many options you can choose , people will very hard to decide to decide .
i 'm going to give you another example of examples , a study about investment in a massive muslim .
a woman who had had access to me with the eye of the eye , the giant people of about a million employees and about 2000 different jobs .
and what she was offered to be a 10 when i was offered to be able to get the peace peace of the tsunami , the only thing was about two percent .
they provide 50 to the 50 eye at -- 10 percent less employees take it to be part than if they 're only going to offer five .
because it 's 50 to the diet of a lot of which you are so hard to decide to understand it , they put it on tomorrow .
and then they go up and then never comes and tomorrow , of course .
now , that 's not just a mean , people have to be to eat , if they go to the fear , because they do n't have enough money to get so hard to miss the decisions of the windows
by the way , by not in terms of the u.s. 20 , a year per year at the field of the field that was happy to learn its coffee forms .
in fact , in the world , it 's a consequence of to many choices .
and i think it makes the world looks like this .
you really want to make a decision , if it 's all the pants , right ?
they do n't want to choose the wrong place back to the false place or even the wrong spot .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the world and come to the decision , we end up less to the outcome of the people , when we had the ability to decide , we could have to choose
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is about the great choice of what a lot of choice are , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and what is there for perfect ? it 's just a different decision that you would have been able to have a
the more possibilities there are , the easier is the easy to have been able to have military care , that 's the choice they meet .
second , what economists do .
dan , he has made a big point of today , tomorrow by telling us how much the way that we realized about , and the way that we compare it .
well , if there 's a very many alternative to remember , it 's just simply to imagine the characteristics of things that you 're laughing from some alternative , you 're laughing , that makes you a given , to the depression you 've got .
here 's an example . for you , that are no new yorker , i really sorry .
but here 's what you should think of .
here 's some on the skin islands .
very expensive real , real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real .
beautiful beach . they have everything that all the self .
what could be better ? `` it 's man , '' `` it 's august .
everybody in my eye is gone .
i could just make it directly for my house . ''
and he was spending two weeks the thought he 'd be missed to the possibility day day from the time that he had a great lot of being a great lot .
so , the great thing is that we get our own beings , even if that 's fantastic , we have fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have the more , the more , are more active properties in the eye .
here 's another example .
well , this cartoon is some people 's point .
he makes a statement on the right , and maybe to do things about it .
but the more one of the point he is that he is : always , they decide what they decide , do n't want to choose to do things .
and these other things about many of the more active properties , and it 's going to do less , will make less and more effective .
third , is the expectations .
this was my mom , when i wanted to teach my home .
i 'm wearing the morning , almost to speak the whole time .
and there was a time where it was just in the kind of form , and they bought them , and they 're bad , they were incredibly lucky and they had their own being , often , often , they 're going to be
so new school was buying the eye of the eye of the time of the time of the old game , and i said , `` i would love to have some more my pocket , here 's my size . ''
and the third said , `` want to be biological , so you know , so you are , you know , `` big '' ?
do you want to write a buttons or anything ?
do you want to be able to do with a tree job ?
if you want to be in the bottom far , the game blah , blah , blah , blah , '' and so on my end .
my business character was down , and after i am in a remarkable , i said , `` i would like to have the way the only way it was the only kind of first . ''
he had no idea what was , so , i spent one hour with all the original people to do this , and the truth is -- and i say the truth -- with the value of the deep spring i ever had .
i had better , and all these things had to have my own possible to me .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote , i wrote a whole book to try and explain myself .
the reason i felt bad with me was to feel this with all of these kinds of possibilities , my expectations for what 's about good to the couple of tomorrow .
i had a very low expectations . i had no more expectations when it was that they had in a kind of kind .
when they came into 100 ways they should have had perfect .
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so what i was getting out of what i was getting for , and what i had had was forced apart in comparison to what i was expected to .
people in people in the life of people increases more and have more people 's expectations , the people who have as good as good possibilities are to be .
and this leads to be less nice with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of the marketing knows what it knows . because if you would , you would , you all know , you know , all this is all about this .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that this was used to be better than anything that was bad than all of the people , it was possible for people to make a safe surprise .
today , in the world of that we live -- we have rich , we have rich citizens to be able to be as an expectation -- the best for a hope that 's so good to be good about how to expect it by them .
you 're never going to be surprised . because your expectations , my expectations .
the secret to the sense of the secret -- that 's what they 're all who they have .
i want to say -- a little bit of time i 'm married -- i 'm married with her wife , and she 's really wonderful .
i could n't do better . i did n't fall to fall .
but in general , it 's not a bad thing .
well , there 's a consequence of the effect of the head of a bad computer class , if it 's just a way to buy one way to buy , that if you 're concerned , and you 're wondering why , who 's in , the world
if hundreds of different types of talk are available , and they 're buying the leaves , and they ask why who 's in charge ?
it 's also clear that the answer is the question that is : they 're .
you could better do it .
with 100 different types of asia in the spring , there 's no excuse for mistakes .
so , when people meet decisions , and if the results of decisions are well good , they feel the drug to themselves , they 're going .
clinical depression 's in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a link -- not the only one , but a relationship to this led to the depression , and also , is that people are beginning to experience the organ are so high so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences ,
and so that 's the trick we go better , we 're getting , we know , we 're getting it , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is an commercial thing that we all think of right , completely wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no question that something has been a little question for a better thing than not , but it does n't follow that more has a more better thing than a result of a little .
there 's a magic amount of lots . i do n't know what it is .
i 'm pretty sure that we have had a long time to have this kind of time we have a long time to do with the public care .
now , as an answer -- i 'm almost finished -- as a change question , which is what all of these things are allowed to be able to the late societies , is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we 've heard about many of them whose problem is not too much .
you see , you see , you have to have some little .
so the things i 'm talking about is a very basic problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and smell , steve brown tells you about how this expensive expensive and hard to do not help . it 's a waste of money .
what i tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy to help them .
you actually get a lot .
they worry we 're bad there .
when something of the people in the society are allowed to make decisions that these societies would have to have , not only to have the lives of people , but our dignity would be better .
economists call this question a trick .
so , it 's kind of going on that it 's all the better -- not the poor -- because all of these big choices are being a phosphorus .
finally , they 're reading to this cartoon , and , a famous person , says , `` ah ! what 's the fish knows ?
you know nothing possible in that table . ''
now , even more than it 's going to make a impact , an impact view of the world -- and that is the way i read about .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the point of view , the fish knows .
because the truth is that if you 're going to do the power , so that it 's possible , you do n't have freedom , you have the middle of them .
if you do it in the touch , so it 's possible , you 'll lose happiness .
it gets the world and they ate the ground .
everybody needs a trick .
and this is almost a lot of perfect security -- perhaps for fish , definitely for us .
but the game is a recipe to be called with computer , and i guess it 's a disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i 've talked about some of these projects earlier about the human genome and what could mean , and the discovery of the discovery of the new groups of genes .
in fact , we start to start with a new point : we have a lot of food , and now we try to try to get this to the digital code in a new phase of biology , we 're making new life and build us .
we 've always tried to ask that way .
what is life ? it 's something that i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and it on different levels .
we 've tried to make a different new feedback to make it till the rise components .
we almost have been about 20 years of disease , when we were able to have a game , the change of the social world of the social world of the computer is the computer .
now we 're trying to ask if we can be able to control lives , or whether we can make new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the fact that the smallest genome of a species can be able to be able to replicate in the lab , and we 've tried to get a smaller bit smaller genome to achieve .
we 've done it in about a hundred and a hundred genes , by the 500 or so , who are here .
but if we look at this , the map that 's very , very simple , to our own trust with our nose , but if we all know these genes , we can be able to take it into a living cell , it would be very unlikely
so we decided that it 's the only way to come up with this stage actually allow us to have the individual components and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to question with the question , we can just cut a organic picture ?
can it be the chemistry of doing these chemistry to make these things that never did before ?
and , if we can , we can go to the building ?
a cancer is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps , we were exponentially exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code , very slowly , are developed very slowly , but we 've got our own point now on an exponential curve .
we started now 15 years ago .
actually , there are a few years of starting to start some years of all this online , and before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to be small pieces of dna , 30 or 50 letters , it 's a trick , so you can make a piece , and you see more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way to develop with these little pieces of pieces and that could be the mistake that we could .
this was our first attempt trying to start with the digital information , the genome in the largest ancient city .
it 's a little bit of the bacteria who are killing .
we 've made small pieces of pieces , made a interview , and we had a dna of the world 's time , and we had a local molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece , chemical , and they took a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made these kinds of , they were making these more
the common particles then were going to be torn up from the cells of cells and turned back back and killed and killed and more and more cheap .
recently , i 've talked to the eye , and they told you that this model is exactly the same thing .
they laugh more than she does this .
so , we think that this is a situation in the software actually , actually , is actually going to build their hardware in an biological system .
but we 're going to go out . we wanted to build a whole game building up a whole game , and it was more than a game company 's time , and we thought , we were , we 're able to do it in the size of
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information , that digital information has to be really sustainable .
when we were able to have the genome for the genome to a mistake in the world , in a mistake per mistake per mistake .
we found about 30 mistakes for the original 30 .
and part of design is , you can make it create 50 letters long , and look at the other skills to build smaller to build these conservation .
we 've built a unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in the way .
think about it : we have a trick code : a very , c , g and t .
so , this letter -- this letter has about about 20 acids , and here is a single amount of a number of the amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we only looked at those first , at first of them .
some people were trying to be trying to be poetry .
we 've got the pieces of so we could use it and we could use it , and there is carbon that it 's ugly and then the ones go back .
and we started to create pieces of view , with looking at the five , five to the five or open letters , they have to make these things to make these back to the order to get to the end .
in any step , we 've been able to create these pieces of being produced with that , because we tried to create a very profound process , to create a very profound process , what they 're going to see in an minute .
we 've tried to get to the point of the child store .
so this looks like a game .
if we 're going to look at large , it 's about 100,000 and about over 100,000 -- that 's not just in the street 's name , and it 's all the opportunities of modern biology . and so we went to other sense of
we knew we were born by a mechanism that 's called the eye biology , and it uses biology to predict dna that can be able to have these pieces .
here 's an example of that . there is a organism called the three million samples of radiation come to radiation .
you see in the upper field that his brain is just simply fall apart .
12 to 24 hours later , all again as if it was as possible as it was .
we can do thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally accessible , they can even live in a vacuum .
absolutely sure life has been there in space and move to search for the game for the conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are lots of there out there .
here 's a trick from the molecule that we 've made that process of that process -- in fact , we use a game where we use the real design of the space we have , yeast , yeast , that 's the way it goes away
this is not an normal device .
it 's a big molecule that we can actually see it with the eye .
these are pictures of six seconds .
that 's the time we 've been finished recently .
so these are the eye code , and it 's the biggest molecule that has been created by with this force with humans .
it has a close show from over 300 million .
if we spent it from a while 10 and not spent it out , it would be close to close to close , just to make that genetic code .
now how do we start with a bomb ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it 's very simple , it 's much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it 's also easier when you 're in the eye as we are , you just take your sleep out and there 's what you 've all heard of them , and that 's exactly what you 've all heard about .
so the way that the field is to put the cell , but recently we 've been shown in recently , we 've shown that you can make a full set of a nuclear set of a nuclear cell to the other of the other things and it can
we 're building the field of one of the time in technology , which is these two of the big one of the way that people and lies , and we gave them a bunch of the way to make this chemical out of them , and we 'd
the new field went into the cell .
we thought that this is what we have is that the end is , but we have tried to bring the process further .
that 's the presence of evolution here .
we 've taken all kinds of species here , or a third chemical of the eye , each time the thousands of things are in just a species to have a species .
so people who are thinking about as a gene that has changed a lot at time , they 're being able to miss a lot of biology .
there is a little bit of sand called the ones that are actually called dna .
the field in the cell was n't there ; the oil that we have in charge .
it was forced in the cell and realized the other gold as a electricity of it , so we had only a cell at the end of a new chromosome .
it 's blue because it had the genes that we put in .
and after a short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , completely in a new species that we 've given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the religious community -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we 've created .
it may be like tea sounds like the ones will move the way to move things quite dramatic .
now , i 'm happy to i feel that this is not the eye -- this is based on the age of religious evolution ,
and i 'm happy time we might create a new form of the ocean 's surface of the ocean 's new face based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious to what we need .
and we 're at a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a thousand billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it to my connection , i was born in the year .
today three people on this planet has shown for each of those who have come in every year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with a break way with working water , and clean water , medicine , on the other one of the two billion people .
it will be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , billions of plastic oil , which is , you know , you have a hundred million dinosaurs on the day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's all co2 co2 up in the atmosphere .
we have now from our discoveries from the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the eye of the future .
the ones had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of the diversity that came up .
we 're going to first line in the first line of biological reality , and to those kinds of ideas .
we 've got technologies because of this journey to do this , what we call `` to fight . ''
we now have the possibility of the possibility of the amount of oil on the day that we can make the day day .
if you do , these 20 million million genes are creating or to make this processes to create a way of drugs or drugs , we can change a very little team of creative change than the last 20 years .
and it 's just the presence of selection . we can do it in the same way , production of chemicals or go to the eye and so on .
that is a shot of a mechanical eye that we 're working on that you 're actually going to create new species in the computer .
you know , we do n't necessarily know what it gets looks like . we know exactly what the most genetic code will look like .
now , we focus on this fourth generation on the fourth generation .
they 've seen recently a square to square , seen what 's just a bad experiment .
we have superstar growth and third generation that 's relatively soon higher to get out of the way that 's happening , at least like , at the middle of the time , at the end of the eye .
but , as we think , the only way to think about biology is a big impact without the cost of food , or the food unit of their availability is , if we see co2 as you as the level of us , and therefore we 're working
and we think we 're going to be the first with the fourth generation , and in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism we described in our own .
he lives in the floor , about miles deep , and it 's almost possible .
it 's co2 in the way it 's co2 about hydrogen use to be a weapon of hydrogen than the use of hydrogen .
we 're looking at whether we can use tens of carbon co2 that simply could be brought out to the place , they 're going to be able to fix co2 in the fuel to make that process .
within a short time , we could be able to be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- as we really -- do n't ask the flow of the whole industry of all of this , and right . right , if you could do that at ted , where otherwise , is the individual of energy .
but the same thing we 're working on is the same way to use the world of the atmosphere .
you saw it this year with the flu , we 're always on a year at the back , and we have a dollar .
i think that 's what changed is that , by making you bring up .
that 's what the future could look like changes with changes , can be the presence of the eye with synthetic bacteria , so and perhaps the eye .
we 're very early years of all of it . our goal is to be a chance to survive enough to do this . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave a confession to the lhc .
and i 'm listening back to come to explain how the machine works .
so now it 's far as far . and for all of those people were n't there , the big scientific experiment is the biggest scientific experiment that was the medical market -- 27 miles in the diameter .
his job is to create the conditions which less than a billion second to begin with the beginning of the universe -- and up to 600 million per second .
it 's just the violent lanes .
this is the machine underneath the machine underneath saturn .
we can take pictures of the eye in the field .
i 'm on this work . it 's called the economic detector -- nine feet in the diameter of the diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of the object that we see .
on 10 , september last year , the machine was going to be the machine for the first time .
and this picture was taken by sheep .
it took the huge ones in the control control .
it 's a picture of the first eye that took all the way around the lhc , then it 's a part of the lhc to make a rain rain from particles on the open level of weapons .
when we saw this picture in other words , when we saw this picture on 10 , we did n't know that the machine is working , which is a big colony .
i do n't know if this was a biggest eye in the google age , or as someone like google and so found the way we did .
it means that we took the cultural impact for science .
about one week later , there was a problem with the machine that had this sort of thing that we had to do with this machine that would -- these golden golden communities .
these are the nest effect by the eye , when the machine goes on the face .
now , the engineers of you will look at you and say , `` no , no one of those things not you . these are little jobs . ''
you can afford that because if you 're far too , very few , you 'll get to see yourself with it .
so in example , from a degree of degrees , more than the space between stars , these communities can cover the tension .
in one of the connections between your eye in the lhc , there 's a trick .
by doing the private ones , and suddenly , to suddenly get some look down the way of the way ,
so this was the result .
now , this is all even more as you think that the average rate of 20 tons of miles and it 's about about 30 inches of battle .
so we 're looking at about the threat about 50 of the personal cells .
and we had to take it away what we did .
let 's get them to new step .
they 're all back again again .
over the end of the 1990s , the lhc will be again again .
we 're going to bring it up , and we can be able to collect the first data in june or july , and then we use our journey , to figure out what the building building cancer has the building cancer
well , of course , in a kind of public level of view , the debate about the debate about science and the eye on these borders . it 's easy to fail .
i think the fact that it is so hard to the fact that we 're going to be able to pull out the borders , it 's a value of things like the big value .
i 'm going to leave my latest words to the english scientist , the way i suspect , what i suspect when he was the most dangerous experiments of his eye , michael , which is there , that there are no security ideas in nature , that our
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
so i 'm going to do books , but it 's obviously more than that .
it 's my big , i think i could love a love and the deep .
and i did n't expect that that is going to change .
however , in fact , it 's a little bit more comfortable in my life and my career is what i 've made to think about , my point to that work .
this is a strange event that i wrote recently recently -- a cup called the eye , egypt , the eye , — this , decided to anyone like that was books , and a big trick , and a big trick , international international
and the result is that i should never get into where i 'm going to be treated as i 'd be the world 's mind .
seriously , very serious , the beginning of the world .
for example , she gets very worried about , say , `` fear do you not fear you will never be in success . ''
do n't fear any fear of that they will be in charge of individual lives and never create a book , the common in the world , never again ?
okay , so that 's what really get up .
but it would be worse if i was n't remember that i was n't talking about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time that i was to be the writer , that i was to be the same kind of eye .
people said , `` did you have a fear , never succeed ?
do n't you fear that you put the opposite world a box ?
did you have to fear that your life 's life never comes for and never , and that you 're going to die on a while with dreams 's dreams -- your mouth filled up with your mouth on the expense of the failure of the failure ? ''
so you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of this questions is : are you all the questions .
yeah , i 've got scared of all of these things .
and i always had to do .
and i have a lot more things about this , fear that no one 's looking at .
like the drug -- and other things are doing .
but , if it comes to writing , i have been thinking recently about this , and i ask myself , why ?
is that being the consumer ?
is it sense that he should be expected to be afraid of to do the work he feels for jobs ?
and what about the creative of the creative protein , we 're going to really make us feel to how to make ourselves more more more more more more than , in a way , what does n't do it ?
my father , for example , was a great , and i can not remember myself in his 40 years of 40 years , which he was asked , were he afraid he would have been afraid .
and you 're with your saying , john -- how do you go with this ?
it just did n't know what she was ?
but to be fair -- the group of the cybercriminals have not received for the most of the eye for the most common people .
but we seem to have this kind of reputation but not just the author , but the creative thing that come out of all the way that you seem to have this call , are being extremely affordable .
all you have to do is the absolute mean of the really amazing ones that look at the 20th century , the young century of the hand died , and often the often hand died .
and even the ones that do n't actually think about to be able to be stopped stopped , seemed by being really high by being slow by their ability .
but , in a minute , before you were in his final interview , you 're going to get a little bit further on my books .
an extraordinary statement , which you can do about your living line .
but we do n't even know if we hear something like that something to tell someone , because we know that kind of thing a long time for such a long time , and somehow we have so forth and more likely to get rid of creativity and suffering
the question that i want to put with each of here is , is this idea for you to be in ?
do you feel about it ? because just with just a plane , i feel not in the same part of my mind .
i find it to me .
and i think it is dangerous . and i do n't really do the same way to run the next century .
i find it better when we live our major creative experiences .
and i realized , i believe , in my situation -- very dangerous , to start to start this dark way of the colony 's way -- especially in the case that i 'm really really interested in my career .
that means -- look at a young , i 'm only about 40 years .
i may have another 40 eye in me .
and it 's very likely to be anything that i 'm going to be , and will be going to write about the world as the work that has just been inspired by the end of the last book , right ?
i tell it it up , because we 're all friends now -- that it 's very likely to be my greatest success .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought of thinking that someone can take to drink nine o'clock in the morning , to drink , and i do n't .
i 'd better continue to do that work i love .
so , the question is : how ?
after a while , the trick seems to be able to do writing , a kind of the eye 's eye designs .
and somehow i have to find a way to write a certain distance , and i 'm going to do it between the very , very natural ted of what 's going to be the response to be the writing .
as i was looking for models for models to do this , i also looked for the past , and i 've tried to find other societies to see if you might help , or a poor ideas about how to help creative risks , with the emotional risks
this is looking to me in the old institute and the old valley .
please follow me because the circle will be close again .
but in the old union and rome , people do n't even believe creativity 's coming to people , okay ?
they thought creativity was a kind of honor of being made from a sudden of conflict , low source to the people -- they come from being smart ,
the greeks called these horrible players ' creativity .
from the design system , it 's known to be a trick that would have a trick to get him out there .
the former the field had the same idea , and they called this kind of choice that creative minds .
this is amazing . the gods did n't really think a genius that was an interesting individual .
they thought that a genius of magic in the walls was in the mind , they literally literally had the presence of a eye , the way that the eye , the eye , the game , the artists , they kind of invisible the work and the
this is brilliant -- there 's a distance i talked about -- the psychological board that you 're talking to you follow your actions .
and everybody knew that it was so working , right ?
the artist artist was in front of the eye in front of the eye in front of the eye , like , for example , to make too much , right ?
when your work has been a great deal of being a great amount of work , you do n't look at all of you for you . everybody knew you had the same way to make you .
if your work is still not , you just do n't your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew their genius , your genius .
so the people in the west were really long time in creativity .
and then the way and everything changed . we had this big idea , and let 's put this big idea : human individual to the universe , we put together the world 's center , and there 's all the way of the world 's center and market
it 's the beginning of the economic age and the people started to start to have been creativity from their own individual .
for the first time , in the history , people are listening to these or those artists sound a genius -- instead he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a human person to allow you to think he thinks , or she is like the secret thing , the `` and the essence and the essence and the source and the most source and the most source , of all , is a
it 's like someone to accept the sun .
the software system and they were doing the phone and it creates all this conservation expectations on success .
i think that this is the game , we 've been in our artists last 500 years .
and , if that 's true , -- and i think it 's true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to an extent of an hour about people and the mystery of the creative box .
maybe you could n't .
maybe we can not save this out of 500 years of 500 years of 500 years , just just just to have waste in a eye 's talk .
and there are people in this audience who really made a very scientific scientific song , that 's the idea of -- basically , as well as well , people and go on to projects and are able to go on for projects .
i 'm not going to take all of them on that journey .
but the question that i want to do is that why not ?
why not think ?
because it makes you a lot of sense like everything i 've heard about when it went to explain the most crazy crazy to the creative process .
a process that goes -- like anyone knows that it has tried to do something -- in other words , everyone here -- not always any of them -- not even outside .
in fact , he can actually feel pretty much a laugh .
i had been a lot of time out , recently of the most successful american museum of stone , who met the extraordinary american activist but the whole life was about the whole life , but she told me that the galaxy was outside , she said , she
she said it would be like a eye of her train .
that 's the country to you go to you .
she felt when it was getting the earth under their feet .
they knew that she could only do that in a moment that was one thing -- and that was -- in her words -- you know , like the game .
she goes as the devil to house while she was taken off the poem . it was just about that they would go to a piece of paper and had to get it to it , and they had to get it to you when they could go to
it was n't very fast with other weather phones , and she 's walking and down , and he goes , but she did n't care the house , and they gave it . she would go on land of land , and i said -- `` go --
and then there were that moments , i did never forget that part of the moments , and she said there was moments that there was moments that i had almost experienced the moments where they 're almost for those moments .
so , you go to the house and you walk out and you walk down and your poem goes through it , and it 's going to be a pencil in the moment and you get it through it , and then she -- she said , `` i
she was wearing the poem at its own one , and she moved back to their body , and i took it on the sheet of paper .
and then , the poem came down the poem and get away on the paper -- but in turn -- from the first word for the first word .
when i heard that , `` it was an incredibly scary -- that 's exactly what my creative process is doing . ''
and that 's not like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel !
i 'm a trick . to work , i have to go to each day for the same time , and i realized , both of me , really careful .
but even i have the thing sometimes that thing in my mind .
and i guess many of you have done that .
and even i had working on , or ideas , who have a source of a source that i really did n't identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we begin to lose ourselves into the relationship without without making ourselves all the way we 've been able to do in mental health ?
for me , i 'm the best living of example of how you create this can create a little bit of the square , you could make it a few years ago in a magazine .
and we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom 's the act of modern , modern artist , who was trying to figure out these 's creative , creative way to control control control numbers and learn
but then he became older and writing . he told me that he went to a bowl of los angeles . and there 's something that works for him .
he was going to speed at high speed as a sudden of a consumer group of a consumer group of a food way of how it 's often for a lot of time , and he wants to stop it . she 's a little bit on , but
he does n't have a piece of paper , he 's no pen ; he 's got a pen war .
so he starts starting to take this old tour of him , like , `` i 'm going to lose this thing , and i 'm going to be losing this song on forever .
i 'm not enough to do that right now .
but instead of panic , he just stopped .
he ended up all of his change and doing something completely new .
he just looked at just the sky in heaven and said , `` okay , you do n't you see that i 'm going to go up with that ? ''
do i go to you like i could n't a song 's song in the moment ?
if you want to have a really , really real thing , come to you a while of the interview , if i can make myself around you .
if you do n't , somebody else today .
go and `` dry '' and ...
his whole line has changed .
not the work . it 's often as dark as you 've done and the fact .
but the process and the hope that it looked was to look at was actually the genius he took the genius , where he was n't going to be in trouble and he left it in a way . he realized that it had to be an asteroid ,
it could be a cheap , surprisingly , weird , bizarre way to work with some kind of conversation between the conversation between tom and the car , health , health thing that was n't at tom .
when i heard this story , i changed a bit of the way i was working , and i had a little bit of them .
and this idea , i sat when i was in the front with the front of the eye , california , who was the end of the field that we all moved in in all of us , all of the field , and the way we fall something
not just bad , but the worst day ever happened .
i started thinking , i should make the project .
but then i immediately talked about how tom was talking in the wild sky , and i tried to .
so i took my looking at the chest `` i spoke , '' and i spoke to the airport corner of an empty corner of the room .
i was talking to speak : `` stop , and i both know both of those book , is that it 's not enough of mine , right ? right ?
because you see , i have anything i have , i do n't even have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you 've got to show up here and share a share of the expression ,
okay . but if you do n't do that , you know what the devil is doing with you .
i 'm going to get writing up because i 'm going to do that .
and i want to put to add you to add that i 'm going today to be a part of the jobs here .
because ... at the end of that as he says , in centuries , in the end of the people in the '50s to get the japanese 's people who have been trained for the five brothers and music , the five brothers have been to get for the
these are always amazing , and the dancer were all right , they were fantastic .
but again , again , it 's a very rare rare , happened something special . one of the tumors was actually accepted .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that everybody in your life have seen a bridge sign .
it was as if the food is going to be used by a kind of a paper paper , and he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before . but all i got all of it .
and suddenly , he did no longer get human .
he was being sitting by the inside , and the bottom and everything turned out through a dry fire .
as far as the back of this happened , people knew what was . they called it it in the name .
they put their hands together , they sing : `` okay , galvao , galvao , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical bubbles are brought out , they brought this practice , the one thing that changed for centuries , in the course of the most eye , the end , the way you still get in the game and hear the eye .
when a small and an infection in spain , in spain , something is done : `` is the end , '' is , `` oops , '' and the end , you can get it , there 's a kind of a kind of a kind of a
and that 's great because we need that .
but , who is part of the next morning when the dancer itself is , when the dancer itself , and realize that there 's 11 o'clock at 11 o'clock -- and he does n't have longer a trick of god .
he 's just a commercial measure of paper 's energy knee , and maybe he never will be able to rise to that much of the day .
and perhaps someone 's going to name god again , if it comes to , `` what do you want to start with his life ?
that 's hard .
that 's one of the eye of a creative life .
but maybe it does n't have to be as much as if you have a very high start , that most basic aspects of your performance of their work of them .
if you may only believe that they 're a philosophy -- from the local source of their life that 's going to be in someone else , if you 've done the deal .
so if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think of security in the past months , while i was working at the book , that soon shows -- as the dangerous , rock , strong experiences in my eye .
what i 'm going to say to myself is , if i 'm going to go about it : did n't fear fear .
it is not uncommon .
just do your job .
it 's always working for your perception , whatever it 's said , `` you know . ''
if you 're a little job , dance .
if the stupid is so , as a stupid , genius , that you 're asked to you , you 're not enough to show you a short moment of your effort and show you , you know !
and if you do n't , dance times your dance .
you 're in the same way .
i believe , and i feel like we should teach this .
so , for example , despite all of this , just in just the only human love and the eye to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
marcus !
last year , i 've shown these two slides of research to prove the journey that 's the high three million years for the lower 48 states in order to 40 percent in .
but this is no longer strong enough to do the level of the particular problem , because it does n't show the cost of ice .
so , we 're in a sense of making the most basic heart of our global health community .
it grows in the winter and fishing summer in the summer .
the next slide i 'm showing is an eye of what happened in the last 25 years .
the eye is with red .
as you can see , it 's the male tissue , this is the male ice in the winter ; and it 's in the summer .
what you can find out is that five years of a blood or older , is almost a blood that looks like the body there .
in 25 years , it will be gone by here .
this is a problem because the warming warming warming the most of the most cause in the arctic ocean where there are large amounts of work to carbon carbon , which is to be able to do by methane , will be done by services .
so compared to the whole range of time , and some of the colors in the atmosphere , could double that amount when we cross this critical time .
now , in some of the most a few , we have now in the few more ] this percent percent percent organization , and now , is far from water in the water .
professor 's eyes in the university of alaska is a very different group of the last century in alaska .
wow !
you 're fine . the question is , how do you get us to a question .
and one reason is that this massive heat is actually actually lower on the north .
this is a new trick .
but the high business are actually much bigger than ever before .
this is the eye river in the face of the defense .
if you want to know , what sea comes down through the ocean , it 's going to the sea .
these rivers take a lot of equipment .
on the other end of the planet , the mountain coast , the largest ice ice on the planet .
last month from researchers , the entire continent now have the negative trick .
and the ones that showed up about a few eye is particularly strong in the ice .
this is 20 feet of light theater , like the greenland .
in the context , the food is down , and you see a new new number of the world in front of a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people that get half of their eye in the world is in that point from that galaxy .
in the 1930s , this glacier is the eye for this city .
the oil have a result of mind .
but if you 're doing , most of the water is doing .
in california , a 40 percent of the eye population of the eye saw in the presence of the forest .
that 's the game .
and the predictions that they 've read , are serious .
and this is the eye in all the world , to a dramatic increase of fire .
and the industry everywhere all over the world around the world , and never been used to it , and did never stand down and never , it never up .
many times as many years as we can do it go into it to the game .
this is a totally game game .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
and in the last five years , we 've produced 70 million tons of tons of carbon -- 25 million tons of tons of tons of them in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific pacific , right , from the american continent , the island of the american cold and the effort of the indian eye , where there 's a complete increase of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest individual factor for global warming , next to this , which is 20 percent , is the equivalent of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most hidden problem .
the united states is one of the two in the most animal , working with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot of other online online
but we begin to see change .
here are the fact that we have been born in the last few years , with some green alternative market , that were expected .
but there 's been a political experience in our country .
and the ones and the end has spent a food one last one , to make clean coal , which is already a contradiction in it .
this picture , you think , is something about something .
and the day it went around to me in her home , and a billion tons of eye is out .
you saw it right in the news .
this is all the eye of the eye of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the signs of the glaciers at christmas is what this was about .
so the trick is a trick , happy americans .
it 's in the way of the and lots and lots of expensive in america , and he 's growing our economy .
so , the trick is going to be a day every day .
he 's got to be a fixed and the fire , and the workers remain on to both bread and workers .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful justice is the head of high atoms .
let me really , you know , al gore , who are harry , harry rule , they do n't know what they talk .
so the production of the epidemic of electric two open open open in life .
this is one , part of her .
and at the presence we 're seeing climate change as a serious danger of our business .
so we have a lot of the eye to spend a more more a more a more a commitment to the way to get the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not static .
we think it 's clean -- and still do good ?
so , do n't worry about the climate .
let 's leave it that this is a quiet .
so coal coal , you 've heard a lot of it .
so , let me give you a tour of this modern , clean eye eye .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it is the sound of the pantheon to make it out .
and yet , the most apple thing by the coal is one of the main things for the global warming that you see here , everything changes everything .
look at it , right , that 's the problem today .
finally , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge , and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all these kinds of money , our eye is rise to the eye coal as the western coal and the hospital is oil .
but now , there 's a kind of a kind of new solution to make us a eye .
now , it 's in risk of america to be 100 percent electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to make america back to work , make us make the global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough , is to solve our problems .
basic parts of america . find more .
this is the last .
it 's about america from america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence in the old , our electrical life , of our own life , reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new power system .
new investment systems to create good jobs .
basic america , it 's time to accept reality .
there 's an old african saying , `` if you want to be fast , go away .
if you want to come far , go together . ''
we need to come far , and quickly ,
thank you .
i want to start to ask you at the time of your childhood when they were playing with it .
as you realized , how to get hands and get the ones that are up and move them to solve and problems with understanding and change .
so that 's what makes you all think more connected to the way we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my eye and go to my online eye and colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we could use computers to move instead of a digital graph , and what if
and the question was so exciting that we decided to have to have the answer to the point of the answer and they developed .
in short , a trick is a interactive computer in the size of one eye .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can pick your movements and you can get a screen and a trick .
much more important : are they 're very physical , why are they just only only to reach by the hands of your hands and move forward .
and the eye is an example of a new generation of education to the museum of a new digital world .
and if these tools are being able to get rid of , and then a consciousness to that it 's more important for your movements , and that has seen each other to each other with you , then we can start with a new new eye system ,
i 'm going to start with some simple examples .
this is the eye for the presence and when i go to a direction , the video is coming , and when i go to the other direction , it 's going backwards .
and these emotional portraits are taking true of one another .
so if i turn out , it will make their interest in .
if you are surrounded with you , you notice that and you can get nervous .
and they are also feeling their movement and get their movement .
now , an interesting impact of interactions we started , was that we could apply everyday ink on data , like color as well as with the eye .
in this case , we 're going to three voices than a game , and i can use them to square color in the middle where they 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
if we 're going to stay on it , we can do a little bit .
there are also some good opportunity in education as we 've been talking to math , mathematics or so , where we want to give people to people , we have to give the possibility of the possibility of the ability to see .
here i 'm -- this is a company that i 'm going to make a simple eye with a simple eye design .
this is a game that is a game that is sort of like the way that it is like a sort of metal tool .
basically you get every video every time on every eye by letters and as you try to form words , and you go through a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , the way that they will , and you have a new challenge and try to try and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on the media lab lab . i could move them to get it and put up a video .
they really loved it .
and an interesting thing to be in this sense is that , you do n't have to have people who need to have many instructions .
all you say , `` do words '' and you know exactly what to do .
so here 's some people that test it .
this is our recent field eye right there .
it turned out he was going to be at the time only to cut the eye only .
they were just the time for him to do any of them .
this is an interactive trick .
we wanted to develop an online system of technology .
that 's blowing into it .
it can bring new characters into the scene by using the table that this character shows .
here he is doing the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he 's going to show you a game in the scene .
the top thing are coming in the top .
good work ! yeah !
by using it , `` by the time , '' and she 's put out at side side side side , and then he can interact the characters ...
... he was invent your own story .
hello !
it 's a story at a open end , and he can decide how it evolved .
flying cat .
the last example of that , for this time today , is to show you about business , which we 've developed recently , that we 've developed recently , and in the order as a sound , like the ones , in the eye and the tumor development
each has got four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can put that sounds into the sequence that you can see in any patterns .
and you do them with a while by having a stick to a eye .
there are the effects that can change live , like , like , air and filters .
you get together with a certain sound and the one of the blind part of the building .
and then the more unexpected effects of the speed and the light that you do in the entire sequence .
so let 's look at this time .
we start in thinking of where we 're going to be in two people 's eye and a half of these things in a series of these things , they 're going to open and add a little bit more the voice .
now i put a ] vehicle vehicle .
now i 'm going to have done some of the privilege to do about this .
and now i 'll zoom the filters with the bus cancer , so i can control the effect of the effect .
i can go down the whole sequence of the whole sequence by using it , the way that i do it , by the way , i do that .
and i 'll just hook the window that have to do ; for something more expression .
i can be in the sequence as you live with evolution .
i do n't have to plan in the front `` plan '' but can be careful , or killed it .
and finally , i can see all the whole sequence by being on the end of the time .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new skills that can actually be able to look like our brains and bodies .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new eye game and show some of the ways that we 're working in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you the way is that we are at this new generation of view of the interaction with digital media , the information in our world that are on the way of our own needs .
thank you .
i 'm very pleased to do this with all of you .
