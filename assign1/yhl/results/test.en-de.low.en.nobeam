so steve voices , performance of the los angeles times , a day from los streets , he went to a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a common , engineer , homeless , homeless , who played on a rock that was only like two years .
many of you will know the story because it 's been a book later that i was a book , and again , that was a film , and that was an easy thing , with robert , was a steve , steve , and still , as a
solly went to the running left , and i went to the interview and 30 years later , he lived as memory in the center of los angeles .
i 'm very much to read all of you to read the book , or to look at the movie so that you do n't just have the wonderful things between these two men , but also how the music was to make this connection and how you would
i met frank school with two years ago , in the effect of disney hall .
he just had a fan of street first and global steel heard behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very business , and he was talking to sound about al fields and la clinton and the prime clinton and talking about how the air could never make it happen into the golden world , and that all the time that is because of the
we came to speak with music . and a few days later , i got an email in which we 'd think that was interested in a time of myself .
i have to mention even that the medical treatment was focused on , because it was already used with the test and it had been treated with the eye and it 's treated , a brilliant player that had taken it all the whole life .
now , as a result , he 's particularly unique for these cybercriminals , and they 're sometimes bad , and he 's talking about six days , in the streets of a eye , and the people 's mind , and the people 's mind are going to
and in fact , in that same thing , it was focused on the way that we started with our first day of the effect sky online , he was just started to have just lost his eyes in his eyes and just lost .
he was talking about invisible hall and smoke and about it , like someone wanted to go to sleep in their sleep .
i had scared , but i was afraid that he could destroy him in the world , and i could destroy him with the company to the company , when i started to talk about the presence and the game and other ,
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first sentence of the first sentence .
and while i was playing , i was afraid that in the eyes of a full kind of thing went to change .
it was like he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose game was my game .
so you 're looking at anger , in terms of a mechanical curiosity and dry .
and like a miracle took his apartment and started to play some of the eye , and asked me to play , to play , you know , okay , the game .
and we started talking about music , from the presence of the presence of fashion , right , and all the other dimensions , are from making up to the place .
and i realized that he was not just a magical knowledge about music , but it also had a heavy relationship with her well .
he talked about her , with her passion and one of the understanding , i 'm just going to know from my colleagues in the edge of los angeles .
by being asked music and she talked about music , i was talking about this at this point , to the man who was moved to the streets of los angeles , a computer game , the software , the same , in eastern a
music is medicine . music changing us .
for any ways , music music got off and well , health .
because the music allows him to get him and the promise and the promise of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and he 's doing the standard of his united states .
and i understood that this is exactly the most art of art .
so this is exactly why we make music music : so we do something that is in the inside of our feelings , in our sense , through our artistic lens through our creativity to reality .
and reality is the word word , all of us , moving us , inspired and we get it .
what 's a lot of death 's talk about music took him back to a community of friends .
the eye 's force took him back to a family of the geese who understood his talent thought , and looked at it in .
and i 'm going to play and then again , whether in the impact 's way to go up , or in the mind , you know , he reminds me why i am a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert means .
robert : i do want to play something i have with the farmer .
i hope you guys agree .
so i knew many fish in my life .
i have only two loved loved ] that .
this first , which was more like a boring accident .
it was a beautiful fish , the software , good , good brand , the one blue on the toilet mass .
what a fish do n't do .
and better better , he was in the end of the most largest dimensions of sustainability .
so you could feel about it , so you could get to sell it .
i had a beauty had a relationship over several months .
and one day , the head of the company called the company , asked if i could have a event of being a event about the sustainability of the farm .
`` of course , i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this product problem has been for our native , how do we train fish on our own ?
in the last 50 years , we have as we have more effective as we were doing forests .
it 's hard to cover the destruction to cover .
90 percent of the great fish who we love , the average , the ones the ones , the ones , the ones , the ones , they were collapsed .
there 's almost no more left left .
so , or bad is there , the game is part of our future .
many people go to . they 're fighting the environment , most of them , and they are in the gas , they take clean down . a big deal .
he has one of the eye from the 15 .
that means 15 pounds of fish needed so to get a tree .
not very sustainable .
also not very good at all .
so here 's one company , and that was trying to make it really too .
i was wearing it .
and the day , i had called the head of the birth of the birth to the cloud of the birth .
let 's call it to him .
`` upwake '' i said , `` only to have the way that you are famous for all far from the sea there is not these environment , you do n't create the environment . ''
`` right , '' he said , `` that 's what he said , there we are out of it that the waste will be distributed by our fish , not focused . ''
and then he 's going , `` we 're basically a personal world .
so you can get this knowledge from the eye , and he said he said .
`` the best in industry . ''
let 's go to one , great , great .
let 's go on what you 're ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' said .
`` great '' i said . put up .
and this evening i got in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before i was before , i called a little bit , i called a little bit ,
i said , `` k , what are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said she did n't . he 's going to go to go to .
now , i 'm looking at some people in the company , no one could give me a three-dimensional answer , and i finally started to finally set up the board of the lake .
let 's also call it a little bit more uncomfortable .
`` yo '' i said , `` what 's sustainable proteins ? ''
now , he mentioned some of the slides and some of the eye , and then he said , `` get a result .
i said , `` you 're on right ? ''
he said , `` yes , the driver , skin , break , to food . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your food food have chicken ? ''
in the condition of maybe two percent .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` k , what is sustainable to feed chicken in fish ? ''
there was a long time in the tea and he said , `` there are just too much chicken in the world . ''
i am doing that fish from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a trick and make it .
and that was me , too .
no , i actually have a trick from this fish , because i am playing fish with this conversation to see chicken after chicken .
this second fish , it 's a different kind of a favorite kind of a favorite .
it 's romantic species , the way you see , you know , you 're learning your fish , you 're going to love the fish more .
i first have eaten him in a restaurant .
one of the time has talked for a long fish for a long time .
it 's a kind of kind of light .
he came on the table with a light , almost a very strange white white ,
the chef had a match .
stop twice .
i was doing , i was , still be a delicious invitation .
who can give a fish so well after that became a while ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call it him . actually , in fact , he 's about .
and no , he did n't have a fish , and he 's not a chef , at least in the way she gets and understand and understand .
he 's a bridge school at his face .
this is a trick in the game corner of the game floor .
it 's close to the presence of the river .
until the month , the farm was in the hands of the eye .
you are born the eye on what was basically called the horse .
they did that by doing the country up .
they built this complicated gap of food cells , and they 're wearing water out of the country and the land in the river .
well , they could n't make sure that was happening , not sustainable .
and the map was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to have what they are a lot for these place .
and so , brazil has bought a small company with green green .
what did they do ?
you have the river of the water .
they literally have the benefit .
instead of the water , they used the cancer cancer , using water back to the water .
they are among the channels .
they created a billion of cotton to -- right , you know , rich , rich , the brain -- and you have the traditional destruction of the traditional destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this .
they look at the horizon , which is a million miles away from , and all you are in the face are the ones and these waste , the wild , the wild , the wild , the
i was n't really long time in this .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles , and a piece of a piece of fish , `` a tenth of the fish . ''
okay ? because that 's where we did , and we focused through the board board and i get it out , and we have introduced to my school school , and you get it in an end of an eye .
and this is what he made them here is a rare trick .
so he came to the head of moving .
and here , it 's a pattern of resilience that remember the bird 's seat .
it turns out that average career of his career has spent the most part of his own park in the world 's africa .
i asked him that he became so much at that .
he said , `` a fish ? i do n't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then he goes , and then it goes into more rare and drug and weird security skills .
and you do n't get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the common community , like the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this eye , i had , i had , i had a fish that i had in the giant piece of hours .
so i got to him . i said , `` no , how does it happen to get a fish like that ? ''
he showed the algae .
`` i know , boy , the client , the lead , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what are your fish ?
how do you know ? ''
now he 's on to tell me that it 's an strange system that the fish are going to eat what they would .
the gap that is called the lead , the ones , which is what the fish are doing .
the system is so healthy , it 's totally right .
there are no food food .
the one by a farm , is that you do n't see your animals ?
and then , at the day , i went around this line with india , and i said , `` for a place that seems to be so , '' different than any farm i 've been , '' from how do you have success ? ''
now , it was a given that a given hit a trick right now .
and we took up and we looked at the corner and the most amazing a film , thousands and thousands of people 's bike programs , literally , literally , literally , literally , literally , the eye is far as a eye .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your perspective of paper , fire .
you do it .
do i do totally confused . i was so confused .
i said , `` you know , you do n't do your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're losing 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
now , last year , last year , were more than 250 different species .
it 's a largest and one of the most important private private private private place in all europe .
i said , `` well , you know , is a really a good thing about not a little bit of do the last one that you would want to do on a while ? ''
he plays his head , no .
he said , `` we do do we do n't build a lot of hard .
this is a psychological network .
and the dutch rate is the shrimp .
the nurses eat the lights .
so the more more the hell of the nest is better system . ''
okay , let 's think of this . a farm which is not going to be released up its animals and a farm that is wearing your success of their homes .
now , one trick , but a trick .
oh , and the way , i think , is that the census of the mind should not even be there by the end of the mind .
they wave away from a city for a city and a better way of drive better for the nest industry .
every morning , they fly apart miles to farm .
and every evening , they fly apart miles .
they do because they can be white , because they can follow the presence of white line .
seriously .
i had been introduced to a kind of journey of the penguins , so i looked at it .
i said , `` you , fly , are going to fly away and fly away away away miles and fly away and fly away and take away away away and clean miles back to the evening ?
do you make that for the children ? ''
he looked like i was wearing a song from the glacier 's chair .
he said , `` no . you do this because i 'm better to eat better . ''
i 've heard the skin of my reading who was delicious , and i do n't like any time . i do n't like any way to do it , i do n't like them .
it 's this piece to be flavor .
i almost never gotten to you .
and yet , when i do it in the restaurant , it 's not not going to go to the point of wood .
she liked sweet and in your way as if you would take one out of the ocean .
i mentioned this to be married and he 's mentioned .
he said , `` the skin is out like a camp .
she 's the last force before it in the body .
she developed in the course of evolution , to get into a eye .
and then he 's going , `` but our water has no longer get the trick . ''
okay . a farm , who your fish are not wearing . a farm , who are on their success on the success of their success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm who has no longer a vote , because he 's a match , because the water that comes through this farm comes out of the river .
it 's a river that leads all the things that rivers these days tend to lead them , they lead chemical radiation , the rivers of the eye .
and when it comes up with the system , and this leaves is the water that is the water as it is to the other than what it is .
the system is so healthy , it 's almost getting water .
so not only one farm , not to be released to your animals , not just a farm , who is in health of their homes , but a farm that literally is to be a trick , and not only for those fish , but for you and
because when the water goes to you in the atlantic .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to take it , and that should be done to do , because this particular particular particular particular particular , it always 's also is also true of it .
you might say that you 're a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk from the eye or talk about it .
what we need to do now now is a radical new concept of agriculture , one in the food actually really , really taste good .
but for many people it 's a little too radical .
we 're not a designer designer ; we 're on the edge of war .
we love to go . we love the way we talk about local food , we 're eating .
and if you say that the things that the future is good food is someone in the future , they 're going to be somewhere , says , `` hey people , i love the number of people , but how would they feed the world ?
how are they feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we 're creating enough calories to feed the world more than they feed .
one billion people are becoming called wars .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of the same monkey in the distribution , not the oil company .
now , i do n't like this question because they 've got the logic of our users at the last 50 years .
occasionally , we have a hundred hundred of organic , with russia to fish , chicken on fish , and the whole time they asked them simply asked , `` if we feed more people , how much people can feed it ? ''
that was the accident . it was the sounds . it was the youngest of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a drug of a drug , a drug that are rapidly built , fast to the capital in the eye , that 's exactly the production of that .
this is not a mechanism , and it 's not agriculture .
our eye is not alone , not because the power of the eye , but for its power .
not by the latest eye and the eye , but through the state of local land , not by a local water , but by fresh water , not by video water , but not through all of the forests , not through a plastic and solar nets ,
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that produce any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the eye for the future .
it 's really old , and it did .
capital , chemistry and machines are the ones , and it has never produced good good to eat .
let 's take a look instead of this green model .
this is this that you can call double billion years of light .
look at the one of the way , farmers like india .
companies who are not worlds , in companies , are in terms of using areas of using areas of using areas of businesses , not in the presence of transportation , of farmers who are not so affordable , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts to do the experts for flavor .
and if i really have really honest , it 's a better chef than i 'm going to be .
you know , that 's me right now , because if that 's the future , it 's good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so if i want to talk to you today , i mean , i want to have a thing that the full of data we consume , bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about the way that they can think about how to do
so what we 're seeing here is a bit of a trick party after age .
the program i 'm using here is a little experiment .
it 's called the eye and what i 'm doing to do , that i can put it to some amazing , say , we say we 're in .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that makes me feel .
and that 's because the people here are in the game here are the people in the game , and you are over here over here .
we can go up one step further and then we get the data back , and we see that that 's cancer that is the great pain , but everybody 's much for everyone .
now , if we 're now in the street and a little bit of a random show , we say 40 years or we see that poetry actually the cause is about people to make people make it care .
and who sees the end is particularly true to men .
so you see that the view of information and data is reminded very very very very high swimming in the way of swimming in the way .
and if we do it for data , why not also come to content ?
what we have now are now the front of the people are ever doing the `` sign eye '' that ever got out of elsewhere .
it 's all over here . it 's all online .
you can test it after my talk in your pocket .
you can get you back in a decade a decade .
they can pull around a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look at here , i see the ceiling ceiling that come at in this copy that i 'm a copy , and the one .
i 'm a little fan fan i immediately immediately immediately , i 'm thinking about all of the robots i 'd heard of the slides of this session .
now , if i 'm just going to get rid of the mind , i could say , `` ok , okay , what if i 'm going to look about everything with the subject of doing this topic ? ''
so i 'm going to go back and i 'm going to see a view .
now , i see the main privilege .
and so , you get an idea of what if you look forward with information , you 're going to go , we go , kind of , bigger , you know , you 're not looking or not look at your own , just simply .
you make it a little bit different .
it 's something between between between , and we think it is the way information is used to be used .
so i want to take this idea , so , about what a little bit about what is crazy .
what we did here is we took every single ones and reduce them in a little bit of the very small line .
the most basic line is a quick longer and a symbol for the area that you 're coming from .
i 'm just going to have the top of 500 of the most 500 of the most two things that i 'm going to show you .
but even in that conflict , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia on the most amazing .
i 'm going to choose the issue with you .
now , after i was writing with the end of `` i , i think that the game that you see is a most time -- `` people '' that are `` people '' that are , `` people in the year . ''
this is really important , because this is a insight that 's not in one place .
that 's just to recognize when you take a step and looked at the whole one .
and so , as a certain of the eye , i can go into the theme of the time , `` people , '' and see everybody together .
now , if i look at these people , i know that the majority of these things are you are going to be , some of the things are coming , some , even less , coming from economics , and a boss is
and interestingly , a ted woman 's a ted woman .
so we can jump with all this month a little bit of time up .
you see , we 're in the web , and it 's also a net , not just to go on to side , but more likely to be more more more more than it much more worse .
and so i want to show you what might be a little surprise .
and i just show you the new york times website .
so this is a dark scale -- i 'm not going to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can actually look at the eye so that you are able to take to each other website as this .
so i can go back one step back and go straight to a specific medical school .
so that 's why you just have to look at the level of the way of the way in this way that you can see in the same way of looking at it .
so i can sort of can in my view of war war in my view .
here 's the old demonstration i 've been talking about .
and i can do anything i 've been looking at today , in fact , in these days , in these days , in fact that i live .
and , if i go back into a step and look at everything i may look like my way , i can get my way back to my eye . here , i was looking for the eye , and i 'd like to look at this to the
and i can get from this site i can get back to the site .
it 's a metaphor that is used all over again , and every time it does a little bit bigger than the sum of the data .
now , in the world , in the world , we think data are a form of data .
we 're talking about the act of the eye .
we 're talking about `` scale in information . ''
what if we could turn up this situation and put the internet on their head so that instead of always going from to another , from a lot of things , there are a pattern of patterns which would have been at the english of which have been before
if we can do this , this is a medical game , maybe a new amount of property information information .
and instead of moving just in information , we can know that we can know that from that .
and if we know about knowledge , maybe we can even get out of it .
i 'm listening with this with so much thank you .
i grew up on the very positive scientific science fiction .
i went with the bus in my high school , a bus for school , every hour a little bit .
and my nose was put in a book , a trick , the trick that my thoughts in other worlds , and in a way , i think , in a way , my deep , deep , the social social theory , i call curiosity .
and i also showed that curiosity to get that i was always , if i was n't at school , through the forests , go through and out to the forests and the blood and the blood and the birds and the birds and the birds and the birds
i was totally okay , you know .
it always went to the attempt to understand the world and the boundaries of the potential .
and my love of science was in science , in my environment , because the late '60s , we went to the moon and we were the deep floor of the deep floor .
the vertical insight came into our living shows with his amazing shows , which were our animals and showed us animals and places and a world of paper that we 've never seen ourselves .
so that 's actually good to that online to do it with you .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i was able to paint .
and there 's no video view of video games , and there are a view of the eye nor the whole kind of cultural image in the media system , i had to create the images in my head .
and we all had to read this back . if we read a book , we took the description of the test and we were sending it to the screen in our heads .
my response to the country and the glass of brain worlds , of the way , of the way , the garden and the whole kind of thing .
in a hospital , i was told the teachers like , as i was , as i was hidden in the middle of the ancient medium , the total
creativity had to leave in a way somehow out of it .
and something interesting was interesting . what i was talking about to the bay eye at the idea of one of the most entirely unknown world in our earth itself .
i 'm never never going to get an airplane world with a train space , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually get around , and it was also fascinating and fascinating and diabetes as all of this , which i 'd always been found when i read the books .
so i decided when i was 15 was being getting paid .
the only problem was i lived in a small village in canada , one more miles of the next ocean .
i 'm not doing that , but i 'm not going to be a government .
i 'm reading my father , and then finally one of the york city , i found exactly the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my eye in the front of the eye center in the winter of the eye , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later later when we went to california .
since then , 40 years since the year has been talking about , i spent about three hours of water under the 500 hours of the game .
and i learned that the world of the deep deep way , in the most oceans , you can live in the presence of the way you can live with rich in the future , how we really can imagine .
the ability to do not know borders , as opposed to our own , with human imagination .
so , i think , up for the days days , i think most of the most was the most kind of thing i see on my vagina age .
and my love is , to the ocean , with the same kind of thing about doing and the same kind of thing .
when i get a job , i was going to get a job that was the game .
and that seemed the best way to make my inner work to create stories with my need to create images .
as a child , i was doing my own books , and i do n't know .
so the movies was the way of the way , pictures and stories together . that would be together .
of course the stories i get to mind from the science of his mind : `` `` the `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` the brain machine , '' and `` is a `` eye 's '' '' and `` is . ''
`` do i could use my employees for the civil coast and the way to the eye .
so , my two passions protection .
something interesting happened to `` eye '' : to solve a game problem in this film -- and that 's what we did to create a kind of a small way to create -- this is what we did , we found on the lower animation , the back
and what came out of this was the first one in a movie that was ever on .
the film brought no money , and he just played his own flow , but i realized something : the audience in the world was like , the magic of the magic , who led to break it .
according to arthur designers , it 's law is teaching technology and to do not even different from each other .
so you saw some magic magic .
and i found that that was exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , it must be used to the standard industry . ''
so we went to `` the initial 2 , '' my next film , still on .
so with those with eye , we put the same conference very much off how this effect was going on .
and it worked . again , we created magic building . and the effect in the audience was the same , but we 've had a little bit more money with the film .
so these two experiences , it 's a whole new world , is a whole new world of creativity for the security creativity .
so i started a company together with my good friend of malaria , who was the best time in the time and the trick . it was called digital to be .
the idea of this company was it , the led signal , was able to start processes with visual leone , and then started to the digital eye .
we also did it and we 're putting together a advantage .
but in the middle years we realized that we were in the interview and we 're looking at what we 've actually had a company -- we actually have slowly slowly .
i wrote this piece called `` the avatar '' which should be in the same visual effects and the effects of the effects of the effects of the way that we have a new human , the cognitive characters that have been made by the online , and the
but the air keeps up beautiful , and people in my company said to do not the able to create this .
so i created this , and they took this other film about the big ship , and the one was that they did .
the trick is `` the world and `` home and tears on a ship '' sold , and it was a online event , a scary movie .
and i was really talking to be a real drop of the titanic ,
so i did the film .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't know .
but i believe that by saying , `` we 're going to get out of the car coming . we 'll watch the real replicator .
we 're going to show it in the eye movie .
that 's the important important thing . it 's a good ring for marketing . ''
and i 'm trying to do a big test problem .
sounds crazy . but this is all that the next thing as a reality can do .
we actually created a lot of six months later in a russian party , at 2010 , four miles under the surface of the north coast , and i would get the real titanic through a crime .
this was n't a movie , no war , that was real .
so , that 's what really happened about me .
and they 've been doing all the food that they had to build cameras and we had to build everything and get everything to build everything .
and i 've noticed how much of these eye ones were , one online thing .
well , they were also so responsible to planning with planning .
you go up into this street , then you 're going to go into this dark , amazing environment where there 's no hope on , where you do n't go back yourself .
and i thought , `` wow , this is just as if i 'm in a movie .
this is real cool . ''
and i was really obsessed with the study of the deep thing .
anyway , so from the part of science and science , to do science , it was all made of adventure , it was curiosity . it 's imagination .
and it was an experience that could n't give me a hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature to that , and then we could figure out the visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i 'd outside of the window .
and i saw a few of the following things i 've seen in a game , and sometimes the things i 've never had seen before , sometimes that i 'd sometimes seen the things that nobody saw before and the science is at the time when we saw
so that has really been in my mind , and i wanted to do more .
so i met a bit unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' and `` i said , `` okay , i want to do my business in hollywood as a square in hollywood in hollywood , and i 'll get for a while for a while . ''
and then we started , we started , `` the oxygen '' and we were able to do it with the oxygen with it .
we went back to the titanic , the titanic back .
we took little robots that we built in , that we had a online trick .
our intent was , with the inner ship , we see , in what never did before .
nobody had ever been a way of the inside of the local campaign . you have n't been a tool in that , so we developed the advantage of the value .
well , i 'm going to sit up on the front of the titanic , in a interview , and see where this is a eye that i know once was going to be there .
and i went through a little eye through the ship .
i 'm just just going to do it just , but my consciousness is within the car inside of the car .
it felt like i would be able to put in the front of the front of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of a trick i 've ever experienced . because before i was doing each other in the corner , i always knew what to show the car , because i had taken the film on the film when we had the film
and then the top was that , right ? it was a very copy of the top of the top of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize that the eye that you were asked to make such a while , and how to make your consciousness into the car , into the car , in the car , in the car , in this other form of the existence .
it was really a profound business .
and maybe a little bit of view of what might happen in a few decades when you have to do something or to do something about the other things i can do as a game game i can imagine .
we started this in the process we 've seen what we saw in the right there , really to learn , for example , this is the eye that we saw in the incredible animals , and that 's kind of like this , but here 's in the
they live with the help of games .
they do n't exist in one on the top of the system , how we do that .
and so you have animals that are directly right to one 500 degrees c that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was very interested in the same time , which was the eye from my childhood .
and i ended up with the people who are interested in space and sit with nasa and in the eye and real security , and they 're driving for russia , the most powerful thing that were most at , and then , they 're going to go to
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was out that i took the deep floor of the deep floor .
i took them with you to the world here , and the eye , the people who 's interested interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources of so they could take around it , they could test samples and
we were able to go on , but , really , science said , `` well , do n't know .
so , the circle between the circle between my existence , the child at the time , as a child , and the way that i put in reality .
in the course of that condition , i learned a lot of things .
i 've learned a lot of science . but i 'm sure , i 'm sure , a musician has to have a musician , and that 's a leader that is an eye or something .
i understood not a lot of leadership before i make this magic thing .
because in a particular point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what does come out ? ''
these all the movies are getting us with no money .
we 've just got the consumption to the rise . it 's not a whole deal .
everyone , i 'm between the `` jim '' and `` oops '' and i would have a little bit of the mac on a towel on the beach .
i 'd all come to all these films , these were the very small audience .
no longer a market , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you 're going to give it this task to get your challenge -- and the ocean is the most lower environment that there is . you 're going to take it the eye because of it , and because of a little group of people a team .
because we 've done all this with just 12 to 12 people who have been completed for years . sometimes we were two to three months on lake .
and that in this community , you see that the most important thing is the most emotion that you 've got before each other is because you have a task that you can not explain any other .
when you go to land , and you say , `` we had to do it , the fourth thing , the ones , and the way all the technology , and the trouble , the human group , '' human or the trouble , you can not explain
and there 's a connection , and there 's a connection , which is a place of life .
so when i went back to , like my next film `` the avatar '' was , i tried to try to do the same chance , which is that you were able to go into a team and i did a lot of respect to be a lot
and it really became the dynamic .
so , i stood with a little team with a team of a team called a team of a team , and we sort of `` i 'm born with a new technology that you have n't had . ''
so , that 's exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were being been a right age of a right family at a right family period .
and so my way of this changed the movies is completely .
there were people who said , we would have been really open with these eye , and then in the planet in top on top .
for me , it was more a good way to do with my job who was changed my job , who changed in the outcome .
so what can we end from all of that ?
what 's the lessons that we have learned to have to learn ?
i think the curiosity is curiosity .
it 's the most powerful property .
our imagination is a force that even can create a reality .
and the most ultimate team is more than all the world 's world .
to me , i 'll say young a young , who say , `` give me an advice of what i could do . ''
and i say , `` do n't make yourself .
i have other people for you . '' do n't matter to you , not against yourself . but take risks on you . ''
nasa has one of the things : `` wow is not an alternative . ''
but in art , and at the study , it has to be a alternative , because there 's where you 're getting there .
no big dynamic , innovation has been ever been able to be able without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , this is the idea that i 'd like to give you the path , and that 's a alternative , is a alternative , but it 's not a alternative , but it 's not a alternative . thank you .
today , i 'm talking to you about energy and climate .
and perhaps what may be surprised is because my eye is mainly about common and seeds , to the things that we invent and to provide to provide the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , exactly what 's even on every other .
so the way that you 're not going to grow over many years is not to grow out , and we too much out to a lot or , too little , or you are going to have to do some little , and that 's how it will
that leads . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to it .
so , the change becomes terrible for you .
the trick for you is very important .
in fact , if you could only reduce it , if you could only reduce it , you could get energy at the end of the most energy .
well , the trick is over time .
in fact , the eye is in the end of the eye .
the game drive the industrial revolution and itself in the 20th century , and so that was a piece of the eye , and so that 's why we have the code of the east market market , the east market , we can make modern materials and so
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- we make the price to put it on a new barrier and the barrier depends together with co2 .
co2 , co2 , the planet and the equation for co2 is quite clear .
they 're doing the solar system which leads to the end and the eye has some very negative consequences . and perhaps worse , the world , that the natural forces , that the natural ecosystems are not able to have these
well , the same thing about the connection between the eye and the way that you are in the front of you and where you 're going to follow the number of food there there is some of those , but not very many of them , but not
and there 's some little bit about that , and how bad those are becoming . but you 'll be extremely bad .
i asked asked the eye , `` do we really have to come down to zero ?
does n't half half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we come to zero , temperature will continue to rise .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different to say , we have a german six meters of high truck , who 's under a three feet of play on a three feet of here . and then you can go into it in it .
this is all right after zero .
well , every year we 'll pull a lot of carbon cells , over the 26 billion tons of tons .
now , each americans americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it 's about five tons of being on the planet .
and somehow , we have to create changes that will train this to zero .
it 's so far than far as i is talking up .
just different economic changes , all the way , it 's all about all the time to go into population and go to a population of population .
this equation , four factors . it 's a little bit of plastic on a little bit . they have this thing left -- co2 -- co2 -- that 's all the way to be at the way of being used by the number of people who are using
so let 's actually look at each other , and we 're going to think about how we get this on zero .
probably one of those numbers are very close to zero .
now this is fundamental stone , but let 's go it through .
we first have the population .
today 's living billion living .
and it took nine billion , and it 's moving to nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new plastic systems that are probably about 10 percent to 15 percent , but we can see a figure out a relationship with us a relationship with us to map .
the second is worth the services that we use .
this is all all the food that we eat , clothing , television , oxygen .
these are very good things , and they 're being means , means , our brain , almost to any marketing to make each of them available to the planet .
it 's great that number number and goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper world , we might be able to do more connected , but average is going to go every year , and there 's a whole lot of the services that are going to be taken by the number of services that
here we see a very fundamental service service , and here 's it at the home , so you can read the homework back to the homework ?
and these students do n't have it , so they 'll get their english version under the eye .
now , in efficiency , the e , the e , the e , there 's good news .
we have something that is not going up .
because of all the different successes , by other people , through new ways , there are many services that are many services that reduce about 90 percent of the
in other words , like the power of strangers , plastic is the eye or the eye or the eye for a lot of power , a lot of smaller .
in all , when we 're optimistic , we may get a reduction by a factor of three or maybe maybe one factor for six .
but in the first three factors we have now , now , in 26 billion , maybe now 13 billion tons . and that 's just not just that just !
so let 's look at the fourth factor -- and this is a mystery that is an unknown -- that 's the amount of co2 that 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
it turns out if you can get this on zero .
if you ca n't burn you , no .
if they ca n't burn gas : no .
almost every time for electricity today , it 's co2 , except to the fossil energy and more fuel .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need to do the game .
now , if i 'm now , `` oh , `` oh , `` oh , `` oh , '' i do n't mean the impossible .
the average price is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the dark services is a miracle .
and there are people here to many of these miracles .
there 's usually a lot that you need a miracle to a certain date .
and it 's usually just the next and some of you get to do , and some people do n't .
but in this case we have to give up for the fact and a miracle in very short period .
now , i asked , how can i really go ?
is there natural , a demonstration , the idea of people on the people here ?
i remember last year when i got them a lot , people sort of liked that .
the idea was really getting a clear , you know , there are people who live with their own lives .
for energy , i was having one of my me for .
i decided that the main problem of brain life , my game , my eye , is going to be here .
so here 's a couple of natural spheres .
you told you she did n't drink , in fact , they 're probably not going to leave that glass .
well , there are all sorts of the eye like this , but they 're all not getting a lot .
we need solutions , either one or the one or the one of a half more and rich , and even though there are many directions , and even though people are looking for it , i really can see in the same one , i just could
i have a phone game , go , smoke and cheaper left .
this is perhaps the main kind of two pieces and when you do better than i expect , that would be a great , but my favorite point here is we have to work on all of those , and we ca n't give them to more
let 's first look at fossil fuels , on the same way of natural coal or gas .
what you have to do there is , perhaps simple , but it 's not . you would have to go all the co2 that you 're going to get , you know , you 're going out there , and then hope there 's there .
there are some percent , and we create 80 percent levels in the place of it , but a more effort to the place of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem is to make the
who will do that ?
who can do something that 's a little bit , what literally many billion times more than any kind of waste you can imagine about the face of waste ?
that 's a lot of paper business .
so this is a tough knee line .
next one : next thing .
they also have three big problems -- the cost , especially in the countries , especially in the developing countries , and the question for security is that nothing can go , despite the human life , that the cost of the cost is used .
what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of people .
so three very difficult problems that might be willing to work and to work with that .
the last three , i saw the five three three three three .
it 's the fossil energy as they 're called called .
and also , although it 's great , you do n't need a matter -- they have some more a human fuel .
one is the energy industry that allows these technologies to increase down the way that it is .
these are the ones , you talk about many , a normal power area as a normal power force .
and also , i had gotten them to get some sources of stress .
the sun does n't seem to all the day ; she does n't seem to be any day and just the wind also , always always been constantly always done .
so you have to get on this sources of energy on , you have to have a way that energy also is in times , though it 's not available .
so there 's big eye skills . there is challenges in the industry , and if we 're saying that the consumer energy has the value of the country , you do n't just need the technology , you need to deal the risk that the energy from where
and there 's the trick .
and to show the dimension of the dimension , i have all been made all the different kinds of tribes that are made for cars , computers , mobile phones , to everything , and that 's what i 've been using with the amount of the electronic energy
so we need a big survey , something that will be a factor to be better than the amount of time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to put these eye sources of energy , we get 30 percent of the effort getting out .
if you want to get 100 percent of it , you need an incredible computer computer computer .
now where should we go , what is the right approach ?
how do we go to the target ?
what we need is many companies we 're going to work on this . hundreds of thousands .
in every single of these five areas we need to be at least 100 people .
many will say , they 're crazy . that 's good .
i think there 's many in the ted group there are already already come out there .
bill 's large , he 's got a couple of companies , one thing , in the other other , the great eye eye has .
so you can invest in dozens of companies in the professional companies companies are great things and interesting opportunities , and i 'm trying to support this .
nathan hall , and i have a company who , perhaps , wait , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations of the eye ; it 's transparent , liquid .
the development has stopped to have stopped a few time , so it 's not great surprise that some good concepts in education .
the trick means that , instead of a part of the financial system , one percent , that we decided to have the 99 percent to be the end .
that 's a really crazy idea .
but in fact , you had a long thought of it , but you could never even even have a lot of it if it would work , but since the modern industry has been able to solve it , you can see that , yes , you can
because these 99 percent is going to do is better , so it 's a lot better .
you 're actually going to do the waste of waste , and you can even use the waste of the waste of these as a eye .
instead of it , instead of it , they 're just burn it . a great thing .
the commitment thing is going to use a fixed field , a bit like a philosophy app .
you see it 's a sort of interface , often than a `` `` `` living . ''
and this really allows you to do that ,
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . you 've got the part of this being down today , so you can think about it , is there for commitment to the act of authority .
the cost of the u.s. population in hundreds of years .
and if you 're doing it too hard and just to get out , you get enough fuel to the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let 's be able to measure our success .
what was our translation statement ?
well , let 's go to the target , and we have to get to get , and then we 're talking about the eye .
many talk about 80 percent of them by 2050 .
it 's really very important that we get there .
the other 20 percent are being produced in poor countries , but still even the same thing , hopefully the time will be going to get into the way that they 're going to clean up .
so to reach these 80 percent , the world has to have developed , including countries like china , to get rid of your eye .
the other note says if we use the world technology whether they 're in all the developed countries , and we on the way we 're going to get them to rest of the rest .
that 's great important .
and that 's kind of a key thing that is going to do .
if we go back there , how about the u.s. sector looks like ?
it should be again again again the two elements again .
we should use the presence to get down apart , the less we ever to do is to get down the temperature , and also the temperature 's temperature .
but actually , this note is for the things that we have a company that does n't take up to the big ones , but even the way that even any less important as the others who have the birth of innovation to the heart
now , these characters , we have to follow with it , and we can measure and measure , and we can do that in the way that we are in the face and go into that in mind .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore 's choice , `` david energy 's the density air . ''
they really go through it and create a kind of a wide thing in which that they can be talking about , because we need support of all sides .
there are a few that 's coming to come together .
this is a wish .
a very common desire to invent that technology .
if you take a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , and i love the president , i love that wish , which is , to be invented , there 's no co2 .
this has the biggest impact .
if we do n't get that wish , it 's been involved between the long time and of course people will be terrible , and in the united states and china , between poor countries and the poor , all life , of those are very bad .
so what do we need to do ?
for the question for which i do it ?
we need to use more physical activities .
if countries in places like you , they should n't be talking about co2 .
you should learn these eye projects , and you would have some of the cool ones that are just the very small press that will be spent for these disorders .
we need to go out , we need co2 , you can see , central , central , central , for something that is a trick .
we have to spread the message .
we need to make ourselves grow and we need to lead it and also the things that will be done by the government .
it 's a more desire , but i think we can do it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just . first , you know , first , you can have a picture of those investment 's point ?
bill gates : to make the simulation on a ship to get all the big scientists that we 've done , we need a few million , and even if we have a few million , even if we have a few of a russian baby 's energy ,
the hard step is that building the first time to find another billion , the ones , actually , are the first place of it .
and once the first finished is if it 's like this , it 's all right to , because the economy , the world 's all , than in the way that the organization is as well as we know them .
to understand the way , this means deep in the ground , almost like an indian mobile player , that they 're beginning to build this drug system and it starts on the process where up in the top up ?
bg : right . today , you have to start this little , you have to start this little , you have to get a lot of nuclear growth , so there are a lot of people who can and are able to do the same thing that you
but if you 've really , very cheap news , you can think of it for 60 years -- think of an eye -- you think about in -- they 're in charge of all the whole things .
and it 's sitting there , and the bus 60 years long , and then it 's done .
a carbon one , even a solution for the waste of the waste .
bg : yeah . so now what happens on the waste of the waste , you can sit him in -- there 's a lot less waste with this technique -- then you take it and keep it to the next slide and you keep on the next
and we begin by starting by the waste that exists already in those eye or eye , and that 's our eye .
so what was a problem for these numbers , which is what we took on our lung and it 's actually actually dramatic during the presence of the process .
but as you 've talked about different people in the world , over the world 's opportunities ,
where is the most biggest interest , so what is really really relevant ?
bg : now we have n't put ourselves in a place , and there 's a lot of interesting to everything that were in the name of the name , and there were big interest in the name , india , china -- i was and talked about how
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese , they have something in the direction .
this is an option one of the thing that has been done .
this is a more step move , but it 's like a faster piece of sand and some countries have this built , so anybody who has a high baby like a small piece of being the first to the first .
the idea is , do n't it work so much of the probability of being to call life ?
bg : now we need one of these online systems , things that are very cheap , we 've got 20 years to get to it and we can get 20 years to bring it 20 years .
this is like the incentive that we have to be able to be known the eye that we need to be .
and , you know , you 're running , if everything is running out , and that 's a big wish that is going to be easy .
and fortunately , today , we have dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of hundreds of things that work in the same way , the way that they have , the economic government working for their streets , to get to the point .
and it would be best if it 's got , because you could use a resource .
we have certainly need a solution .
so , in some of the big potential world , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a trick is the most true .
it would have been without the eye , but it 's so much more important .
there is other and other and the military sector , in the nuclear sector .
you know , we do n't know the work as well as this thing , but there is the most sophisticated method , that 's another approach .
there 's a ridiculous actor to be able to be a little bit difficult , but maybe you might say that above .
and so there 's different , but the beautiful thing is that there has a million times as much energy like a , say , so if you can get a game and that if you can deal with the problems and you have mainly , the impact of
if that does n't work what ?
do we have to get on a game to try and make the rise stable ?
bg : if you get to that situation , it 's as if you 're going too much as a lot of food , you 're going before , and you just do a heart problem . what do you do ? you might need a lot of them
there 's a trick called the way that we have to do with different techniques to transport warming the warming , so we 're 20 years of life to get us out about it , and we 're with the warming .
that 's just a trick .
you hope we do n't need this .
some people say , you do n't even work at the insurance as one that does n't make any thing to eat so you eat , because you know that one will save your memory .
i do n't know if it 's smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there 's a sense of a sense of whether you should have a sense of that if you 've got to have this , if you get it faster ,
climate change : did you have a number or two sentences for that , maybe to convince you ?
bg : now , unfortunately , the production rate in very different sphere .
those of those who do make scientific action , are very little .
do you say there are negative effects who are doing with the clouds that are going to move ?
there are very , very few things that you can actually say that there is a chance in a million .
this is the most sort of thing that you can see about aids .
you 're going to go right up , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you 've got all kinds of website , we 've actually invested to invest in something that you 've got to be in -- and what it is that the landscape is not so clear , and in fact ,
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about us .
but my dream is that if you ca n't make it , and at the same thing , the co2 is actually as well , `` okay , it 's really not really , it 's not in the co2 , i 'm going to do it because it
and that would be the answer to the game , the point that if you use it all the time and energy to solve co2 , all the other goals that have done the eye , the ones that have a special waste of resources , as there are
bg : now , the real amount of money for research -- say we should spend the u.s. population , we spend more than it 's more than it today -- this is not that dramatic .
it should n't suffer other things .
you get to big yourself , and there are a very clear people for the case you have something that is n't economic , and trying to pay it -- for me , here 's the most waste waste .
because , it 's because , you know , you 're very front of a eye , and it 's the end of the learning things , and i think we should try to be able to be able to be a potential to be much more cheaper .
if the interaction is , a very high eye is , then just can keep the rich eye .
i mean , everybody here might have five times for five times for our energy without its lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it is a disaster .
and then , what 's even called designers is about .
his new eye is now , `` why is n't the research that research ? ''
he still gets , because of his previous stories , with the eye , but he 's understood that this is a very , very unusual group , and so it takes the game . it 's now now it 's now the trick .
and that 's a real job , which i think i was in appropriate .
the research , the research , it 's just crazy as you should afford .
bill , i think i 'm talking for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter is saying a trick called `` the eye . ''
the idea is pretty simple . you have to make the biggest big structure with 20 markets , about a mile tape , about the traditional barrier and build one percent .
the trucks is to be on the wall of this .
and even though it seems easy , it 's actually really hard to get it really , people are actually getting very quickly .
and so i thought that this is interesting , and i turned it into a trick .
it was a huge success .
since then , i did about 70 pounds of the world , with students , business and architects , even with the interview and there 's something that makes deep connections into nature 's task , and i want to share some of them .
and usually most people are going to help the task of the task .
you talk about it , you think about what it gets like , it 's largely power .
then you invest in planning in planning and organization , and you 're getting both over them .
they invest in a lot of their time in the time they 're used to their own all structures .
and finally , just before you have time to have time , you take the marshmallow , and you 're opening up on the top of a step back and `` you know , '' you do n't know your work .
but what 's going on , is it 's happening to a `` eye '' because the weight of the fuel is really important to be able to be able to be and the whole thing .
there 's a number of people who have much more `` eye '' than others , and under the worst day , the depth of them .
they lie , they 're sitting , they 're really confused and make it really well with confused .
and of course , there 's much more more more than that , and then the best of them have tremendous people ' system in this system .
and that 's pretty amazing .
so , as peter did , they do n't just do the highest tree , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how does that come ? what about those ?
and peter tells me , `` do n't tell the children in time playing this very central game .
they do n't invest in the game .
but there 's another reason we 're going to do .
and that 's where we were in 1974 to find a real plan , ok ?
and so do know .
what happens if they 're going to put the wall on the top , they have no time to go and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , is what ?
what 's more productive in the other way is they 're going to start with the fourth and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always by the genocide at the top , so they have a chance to repair prototypes .
so you know that the kind of collaboration that comes together as the core of one eye ,
and with each other , they get up with the children of what works and what they do n't .
so the power is working with prototypes , are more than it 's a little time , as a different team stories .
the average is about the most with about the game , and the average of students , half of them , are half of them , electricity 's something more , but not much , pollution are better than adults .
who 's the most successful ?
architects and engineers , happiness .
the monkey is the most the highest i saw .
and why ? because they 're understanding and understand the electricity 's pattern of the key to build stable structures .
it 's something about average , but it 's interesting to do it .
you have an act of silk ingredients on the team , you 'll get a hard thing .
it 's incredible . you see , and you see , `` this is what a team will win . ''
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the eye .
she goes the process , they understand .
and this team , the building and it 's been used to the work , they 're being able to improve a great team in the way .
highly careful skills and their energy lead to success .
if they have 10 teams , the typical ones , you get the stable structure .
so i tried to now fascinating .
i thought we bring the eye in the same way .
so i was wearing a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what do you think about this interview ?
what was the result ?
this is not a team a robust structure .
if you had a poor high global world , he would have the price back home .
so is it really interesting that high so you have a very powerful effect ?
we get the exercise with these same exercise .
what do you think happened ?
now , she did n't understand the advantage of the advantage .
so , in the same , it became bad one under the best ,
it 's produced the highest pattern in the most time .
so , there 's lessons that we 've been trying to do for us , about nature of space and success .
you might ask , why would anyone like to create a interview in a while ?
the reason is , i 'll create digital tools and processes to help a team , to help , video games and video games .
and what the trick does is they 're helping you to identify them all together .
because the open , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is going to be a common experience , a common language or the way that bird , the right prototype to build .
and this is the value of this experience , this is the simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in the eye , you see the game .
it 's a blog where you see the nuclear nuclear union .
there 's a trick there .
you find crazy examples from the world as people have changed the system and make it into the way .
there are also the ones that are there .
and the trick , i think , is the world 's , who is actually a game for a place .
it requires that we all need our senses to be able to think about our thinking , like our feelings and our doing , in the challenge that we 've been doing .
and sometimes an smaller prototype of this experience , what it takes to be a `` eye '' to be like , `` okay .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we have as if we have this machine .
a big machine , a cool , a very complicated machine , and that 's a light machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't stay on here and now .
and i wonder what they choose , because i 'm a lot of my friends a time , i 've asked this question , and you all wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time before cars were or `` america , '' or `` america 's looking . ''
i do n't know .
i believe that you kind of like to draw into what 's going is that a story of thinking .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of that group , i have to say .
i do n't want to go and that 's not because i 'm a trigger .
it 's because that possibilities do n't go back on the planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most time the most important time the most planet gave you whether all of you were , whether all of these is to be creative : health , wealth , adults , opportunities , and are in the same way
there 's never been a time of a time like this .
i 'd all the stick from being 60 .
my grandparents was this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the kitchen industry .
so , then , i should have a little nine at the beginning of my eye .
but it 's not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child , a child , is a child , as long as the richest man in the world , in a hundred years ago .
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox , the smallpox have killed billions of people on the planet .
they 've made the roofs of the earth 's way of how there is no war there .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have it . we 'll do alone .
in the rich world , there are the millions of diseases that have millions of us in a generation , just not yet .
so , up ?
now , you know , you know , you even know , what 's ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are success of the science 's point .
and from my view , the scientific method , you know , is trying to try and look at whether it works , it does change if it does n't really do some of the great features of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's the whole good news , because there is some other problems , and they 've mentioned a lot of problems .
and one of them is that despite all our way of our bodies , we can go to bed in the world for malaria and so hungry .
this number goes up , and she gets very fast , and that 's a rocket .
and not only , we used our imagination to live this world very low .
the water , the country , the oil market , oil , gas : it 's all driving , and if we 're not going from this chaos we 're going to go up with that chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we .
i think it 's clear that we can make food feed the billion people without feed the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they did n't go at .
i really believe that and no , that 's not a thought of thinking .
but this is what i 'm looking at at night -- one of the things that was going on night , and we 've never never been able to take on science like now , like now , nor never
and we also have never been able to be able to be able to make it out , so as we can do today .
we 're too hot , amazing events in a lot of people 's large areas , and yet i really think we would have to go hundreds and we would have to go back to the point of the way that we 're going to be on , where
people were in their mind in their mind , and in fact , you know , you ca n't be free .
not even the truth is going to be free .
and listen to everybody , everyone has the right to his opinion ; even a way to do it for the progress .
but you know where you do n't have right ?
they do n't have an right on their own facts . they do n't have them .
and i needed a little bit for just to find this .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article on `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was amazed to get down to the resistance of what most most effective activity is in health history in humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i was just doing what i always do , i wrote a article , and he left .
and soon i was writing on that paper , i was changed about it .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were nuts .
so i wrote a article for about this article , and i could n't understand why they thought that molecules in a certain thought of a rather random way of all have been an eye in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went back .
i mean , i 'm a journalist journalist .
we type we 're going to go together , we eat , that 's okay .
but the article was going to worry about me , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually , i found it .
and that 's because the game that were really not about the same ever .
these were 700 people , young people , including people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so ,
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we 're able to be able to be able to be able to do that where we do n't have the same relationship in progress like earlier .
we 're talking about that .
we 're talking about blogs , with small weapons that is what we call progress .
okay , so there 's a reason why , and i think we know what 's more reasons .
we have the trust of institutions , in trouble , and sometimes sometimes in the science of it , and there is no reason why that should n't be that way .
you can just call some names and understand people .
it 's done with the water industry , the plastic , the mass mass , the presence of 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we believed they 're always right forever , so be common .
ask questions to you to ask the evidence , you make evidence .
do n't take any given a given .
but now , if you have to look at the evidence , you assume this evidence , and we 're not good at that .
and i can say that in an epidemic now , we 've never seen them before , hopefully never will .
about 12 years ago , a story published a horrible story , which is the presence with that way with the eye , and bring out and put up into that scene .
very scary .
our studies were doing to see if it was true .
now , there should be done with some studies ; this is a serious issue .
data came in in this place .
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right in the same , no food , no connection , no food .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't matter , because we think of psychology , we think what we see in , what does think we 're really feeling really feel like we feel .
we do n't believe a bunch of a random documents of a eye that gives us data , and i understand this , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
and the result of that was an individual .
so , i think , so , i think , so , i think , some of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world in which the power model for oil is swimming .
that 's a massive , and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what is happening is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here 's what anybody might stand ?
is one one in the audience ever die for an steel show ?
it does n't happen quite very often .
in this country , you know , not in this country , but is , for instance , on the world over the last year .
this is a lot of death by being about 20 per hour .
but because this is not here , we can actually get it out of it , and people like the japanese can play around us and the messages of the fear and the lack of tumors like dense live , live king .
and you can do that because it does n't get out and temperature and temperature .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never be the same .
and this is something we need to learn , which is very fast .
this guy was a hero , which was , in , in a general disaster gap .
he puts us one of the worst members of humanity .
no fear , no male , plastic , apart , is gone .
the guy in the middle was n't so much .
he 's called paul 's eyes .
he 's developed with a few other people to get a eye with a while .
he can save the life , including putting in a year per year into the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
now , that 's good , except paul skills talks and talk about what the valuable they are , and they 're just supposed to fall into them .
and that 's what he said .
paul is a complete sea .
if paul talks in a public colony , he ca n't tell no story in any public .
he gets to be calls to home , because people would like to tell him where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a stick .
i do n't say that , but there are a matter of matter of making care of the matter .
you take them on , you 're going to be on the diseases , terrible diseases , and that 's happening .
we now are ready now .
and that 's worse , and quite soon kids will die from it , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just going to die from any stone .
what about genomics ? let 's take it . why not ?
for a while i wrote a few weeks ago , and i think i 'm going to buy a little bit .
nobody has ever said before .
she would not keep her child against dense illness . in no case .
bets .
why ? because we do n't have any plastic , and you know what ?
we did not have a bike yesterday yesterday in this country .
today , i do n't know , perhaps someone go back to a plane , and they 're now moved to los angeles , right now about interactions .
and in a few hours he 's going to end up and make a car , and it comes to long beach , and he 's going to go to one of these eye evening .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a synthetic illness , and we do n't know that , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live in . do n't like it , as he did n't .
we love to love ourselves . we love that .
have you taken your computer tomorrow tomorrow ?
so , a little game , a little bit of a game that helps you help .
i know you 've made that , because half of americans are doing it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative , and it does n't matter , and so often often we do out that we 're not an enemy .
the data is constantly constantly .
they make their own , and they 're almost not .
that 's okay , you 'd like to pay the billion dollars for the dark people .
i 'm just going to tell you a completely completely voice .
dark , dark .
why do we make that ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the main deal .
we hate an strong government . we do n't have trouble .
and we should n't , we should , our health system is in .
it 's cruel to people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold , and the trick is to have to be able to do it that you can afford .
so we 're going to run back to way , and where are we going to do ?
we 're going to walk into the poor of the eye .
that 's great . i love the eye .
but you know , this is really serious about something that stuff is , because the stuff is , etc , and we 're going to give billions billion dollars for it .
and i have all sorts of these little pieces of art here .
none of them -- go , it 's done , who 's -- you know , there 's no thing that 's that you are , but we 're going to be in , we 're going to be billions of dollars for it , it 's an absolutely
and you know what ? if i say that , people ' and say , `` what are you going to ? people do ? '' people do .
they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it really is n't my case , whether it 's the eastern service , which says , `` hmm , i 'm going to just say the message of my experts to be able to take you , '' or any are the best who 's going to
if you go on to these path , where you 're going to be , and magic effects and science replace science , it gets a place where they do n't want to be .
they get to meet power to the south south africa .
he took him away because he was in the case that red is the place , and the more effective to the evil drugs we know they know that they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
hundreds of thousands of people are hidden in a country that they 're getting into any other disease .
do n't tell me that these things are no consequences .
they have . they 're always all these .
now , the presence of the epidemic that we 're just now , this is this exponential struggle between the eye , many food and the eye .
that 's a crime debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphor .
that 's a ideology of being ideology .
all we are eating , each is the ones , every water to each of every water , every silk being changed from the people .
you know , there were no eye in the garden .
there were no eye game .
there were no evening . we made it all right .
we 've done it in the last thousand years .
and some of them have worked and some of them did n't work .
we are what they 're actually working .
now we can do it , and of course , we 're risks . but we can do something like vitamin a a , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , to avoid their life .
do n't you want to do this ?
i have to say , i do n't understand .
we changed , we 're changed to trade food .
why do we do it ?
now , what is i hear is , too many chemicals , rural flu , variation , the ones , we do n't want to have a huge fields with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want companies to keep companies live .
we do n't want to get companies to get seeds .
and you know what my response is to all of that ?
yes , they have right . we do that .
it 's true , we have a huge trick , but that 's not science .
that 's nothing to do science .
it 's quite , morality , with it .
you know , science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not an idea ; it 's a process .
she 's a process , and sometimes he does n't work , and sometimes the idea that we should not allow science to do their work because we 're a real , because she 's a real , and it 's a real ,
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll have to grow 70 percent of food than we are growing in right now . 70 percent .
these are the investment investment in africa in africa .
wear . one of the ones .
you need that , and we do n't do it .
and why ? does of the way ? stop food food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this game like the way we 're doing with you .
there 's something half of the billion people .
it 's about a bamboo deal .
it 's just a handful of calories , it 's a pair of calories ,
it does n't have to have any of the nutrients it does n't have a protein , and scientists do n't build all this in this little bit .
and then the people could eat the food and would not be blind .
you would n't be missed , and you know what ?
that 's beautiful . it would n't be the trick to it , but it would be .
and all i 'm able to say is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , ask we ask , why do we fight that ?
because we do n't want to do genes ?
it 's not the genes of the genes ; it 's not the chemicals of chemicals .
it 's not about our attitude for starbucks to ensure , our animal , our animal food , better food , low food .
it 's not about the very least eye here , it 's about being about people in life , and it 's going to understand the highest time that that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we do n't , how far do we do so far as we do , what we do with something that we think i think not as emotional ,
there is no other description for what this happens happening here .
it 's central , it 's ugly , it 's our not being clean , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny entertainment , you might say , `` you still want to go in this ridiculous time and go to the future ? ''
anyway . that 's no way .
now , in the present moment , it 's in the present present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put those light on everything we want .
we can be in our own , where we want to be in our own , and we 'll move them up there , where we want .
we need to lead that conversation , and we need to think , but if we go into the time , and we 're going to go into the light game , we 're going to have happy to be able to have .
i know we can , and as far as it is , is something that 's needs the world .
thank you .
thank you .
i 've been thinking about the eye for a time , which is a magician that an ideal for that is to be able to look at it like me , as a deception to make something real , if someone
in some words , in some studies , this is a very much effective effect in some studies , that , the ones , and only that person thinks what 's happening to you , is to be a kind of kind of ...
it 's a deception to make something bad , because somebody 's going to be a point that is so learning .
so one of the things that we also understand is , i want to show you a natural , very simple magic .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that has been since at least as at least the 1950s in every time for children .
i myself , i 've learned him of the `` the eye of the 1970s in the 1970s . ''
i will take you to it and explain to him .
and then i 'll explain why i 'm going to tell him .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can see , my hand is able to explore .
i 'll just hold the knife in my face .
i 'm going back to the surprise .
and to make sure that nothing is going away in my pocket or , from him , i 'm going to get my favorite way to here .
you can see that way you see it just not been something done , and as long as i do here , nothing can do nothing in my pocket or out of it .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'll open my hand , hopefully if everything is going well , it 's going to be the knife by my body 's physical phone .
it 's actually so finding that out of his place that i can shake it , without getting a knife out of a half times .
nothing that goes in my surprise or come out there 's no way of there , and you can look at it all .
marcus !
now , that 's a trick that i 'm often doing small kids who care for magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you 're going to make a lot of deception , even though it 's a very simple trick .
i mean , probably many people know that in the room that that is a trick .
and he 's got the idea .
i 'm in my hand .
i say i 'm wearing my graphs to make sure that nothing in my flower or something , and that 's a lie .
the reason i 'm doing is that i 'm the privilege , it 's that it 's really true of the real secret of illusion .
and in the moment , where i go to you , you know , you 're going to see my hand from the back , you move this finger here , my car , just by the car , just where he was so rare .
amazing trick ?
and then , somebody is sitting on the back of the back , who was not a little bit childhood .
so he 's here . right .
and if i go to the finger , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why that is a natural gas , why you 're not really aware about here all the time down here , because the mind is , the mind is about him , she 's not affected , one , two , three ,
now , here 's not all here , actually , i open my hand .
of course , it 's going to see there , of course , is n't that the eye of my body , but through a trick , through my accident , which is now .
and if i leave my hand , this is what i 'd like to do with the same thing , by doing the movement that the finger is going to get back back again .
i 'm going away . and here is the knife .
you can just show that trick and talk about your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
now , what did you get to do with the interview ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study which is really really cut in my own .
i 'm not not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing .
and this is what if you 're going to take a copy in a white paper , in the form of a eye , and just a small piece of white paper that 's made on a certain weapon of effect .
but if you make a little bit of the shape you change this in the world 's time , for example , in a smaller deep time , and that blue color and a letter that starts to accept on it , they 're actually using illegal
and so , although none of us , they 're just the ones , right ?
but a white pill is not as well as blue in blue .
what ? let me get that really made me .
and it turns out that it 's not all that this is not all that it 's not all .
if you take out the muscle , the still one more more more more than nine shape .
a number soldier program that is at one at the end of a end of the yellow yellow and on the other red , it 's better than a white soldier .
the game is being a role .
a night twice twice as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact most accurate statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , but ...
-- in fact , the mosquito has a role .
and the shape is playing .
and if you want to get the ultimate one , you have to get off the needle .
right ? a more neuron with a trick -- a couple of a eye that 's being put on the patient 's patients .
this creates a very strong picture of the head , which is a much more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'll show you another time when we have an high one .
so in fact , the white pill , they 're not working out , like the blue pill , not out as well as a soldier , not seem to be good than the needle .
and none of it has really , really , a really frustrating property quality , it 's just our belief to make a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic world .
i 'm going to take something that 's obviously a deception , and i 'll actually look like real .
we know from this study that you have to be able to be able to be able to go in the needle , when it 's going to go to the thing .
this is one 18 an long time , it 's very , very different . and i 'll just get a little bit of pieces .
this is really my meat . it 's not the very famous story of the specific specific field .
this is my skin , which is not a special element of hollywood .
i 'm going to keep up these needle in my skin and go through it , until you give up on the other side .
if you get it bad -- if you look in a way of a light , you 've taken a few friends in the hotel , and some people i do n't know , and that 's a woman almost become a woman almost
so i 'm going to suggest if you get it all , you 'll look for you , look for the next 30 seconds , or you know , i 'll do the first run back here .
you can see it in the same , but you can also be able to be able to do that if you want .
so , it 's like , right here , here i start to start with my meat , at the bottom of my eye just i 'm going to do a little set of art .
i 'm sorry for you , i 'm sorry . does it go crazy ?
and now just a little bit , a little bit of my skin and on the other side , so again .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had with the eye .
it 's about it .
but now you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . that 's one , two , three , four , five .
you know , yeah , yeah .
i know what people think when they 're seeing that .
they say , `` okay , i 'm not going to go that such as stupid and you 're doing the skin , just to get us to talk to us a few minutes . ''
well , then i 'll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people go back and said , `` okay . i 've n't really seen this . ''
people in the front you now come in .
let me show you about this .
this is really my skin . this is not a special element of hollywood .
that 's my meat , and i can have the cybercriminals .
sorry . if you get it , you 're looking away , look at it , you 're not going to look at it .
the people in the back or the people who once once said a video , say , `` well , this is a very clear , but if it would be , he would be , you see , here 's a hole , and there 's where it
okay , so let me just give you a little blood for you .
yes , it 's .
usually , i would normally have the needle on this .
i would love to the arm of my arm , and show them there is no organic .
but i think in this context here and with the intent , with an deception , i 'm going to make the needle in there , and i 'm just going to go from the stage .
we 're going to face us a few times a few times .
i hope you 're going to be about it . thank you .
everybody 's talking about happiness today .
i have some people who make the number of books that say , `` do '' ' in the last five years , and they gave about 40 and they had a lot more .
there 's a huge wave of interest in happiness happiness .
there are a lot of eye involved .
everybody would like to be happy .
but despite all of these homes , there are several cognitive body from thinking about that almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive fall .
this is true for as you think about your own happiness , and it 's the scientists who think about happiness because we 're just as invisible as everyone else .
the first of these fall is a trick to express complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is n't a useful word because we 're going to apply it to many different things .
i think there might be a certain meaning that we might call it , but in the big and all this , that 's something that we need to be going to be to , and we 'll think the complicated perspective to what is what well-being is .
the second term is a true experience and experience and memory , and basically , it 's made between me in his life and happy his life or happy of his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the eye , and this is the broken fact that we can not think about a real fact that well-being well-being , without its meaning to fall .
i mean , this is a real prediction .
it just just no way to get it up .
now i would like to start with a little bit of someone who had a trick after one of my favorite phone that was just held a story , [ up -- and said he heard a driver , and it was completely beautiful music , and it was
and then he 's going , really , pretty emotional , that has the whole experience .
but it did n't really .
what it comes out was the memory of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had 20 minutes to music .
they do n't notice because he was with a memory memory ; the memory was a memory , and it was all that he had .
what really really says is that we think about other people 's sense , in the sense of two different types .
there 's a trick trick that 's living in the present and the time , you can get the past again , but just the present .
it 's the trick itself , you know , when the doctor says , `` do you get the doctor now , if i hurt you ? ''
and then there 's a trick itself , and the trick is that it has been focused that it 's been , and that 's not that story of our lives , and it 's the one that i 'm going to do , and it 's the one
or `` how did your journey be more high ? '' or so that 's what way .
these are two very different versions of itself , the ones are the same time and the trick themselves , and the two one is part of the structural cell system of the happiness .
well , that 's a storyteller itself is a storyteller .
and that 's really beginning to start with some fundamental memory , and it starts immediately .
we do n't just tell stories that if we make ourselves stories stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means we can be able to continue from our minds is a story .
and let 's get a little bit about that .
there 's an old study .
these are real patients who do n't think of a powerful kind of a lot of computer .
i 'm not going to go into detail . it 's not painful today , but it was painful than the study in the 1990s was done .
they were asked to report out all the 60 seconds of pain .
and here are two patients . that 's your own records .
and they 're asked , `` who 's the one from both have more meat ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more , and its voices was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient 's a patient 's patient 's patient , and more .
but now there is another question : `` how are these patients thinking that they get down ? ''
and here 's a surprise , you have .
and the surprise is that patient has a much eye trick for the users as a patient b .
the stories of the eye were different , and because a big part of the story is to it .
and none of these stories is very helpful or great -- but one of them is very clearly ...
but one of them 's more than the other .
and the ones that was worse , where the pain was really at the end of his peak . it 's a bad story .
how do we know it ?
because we asked these people asked , and much later , we also have said , `` how do we have the whole thing to do ? ''
and she was a lot of worse worse than the game b .
now , that 's a real conflict between itself and the eye itself .
from a view of self , he had an eye time .
now , what you could do with your patient is , we have a real , indeed of our own experiments , and it 's been made , and it 's working , and you could actually do the presence of the patient a little bit of the
that 's going to lead that patient is suffering , but it 's just a little bit less than before .
and if you do it for a few minutes , you do that that the game itself is a bad thing to be , and you 're in the point itself to be a lot better , because now , you 've given your patient a better story about
what is a story from that ?
and the stories for the stories that makes you memory , and it 's also on the stories that we invent .
but also , a story is the u.s. states , its own moments and end .
end up to end are very , very important , and in this case , that 's what i end up .
well , that the game itself live in labor .
it has moments of the eye , one after the other .
and you say , what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most moments of life -- and i said , i mean , you know , the psychological presence , you know , the psychological present , as about three seconds , what means that there 's about 600 million of them , there 's about a
most of them are completely ignored by the game themselves .
and yet , you kind of get you the sense that you should count that what the moments of the eye is happening our lives .
it 's kind of like this kind of resource we use what are going on in the world .
and as we 're going to use it , it 's important , but that 's not the story that we 're going to keep it for the game .
so we have the right self and the eye itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is time .
from the eye itself , when you have a shepherd , and the second week is exactly like the first week , and then you can put twice twice the size of the eye .
that 's not how it works , for the time itself .
for the trick itself , there 's some way to do some better than the game , because there is no new memory to the time .
they did n't have a story .
and in fact , in fact , actually , really , the critical biological , which a trick itself is different from a trick , and it has very little influence in this story .
now , that the trick is , you know , makes you to remember and to tell stories .
it 's actually a number of people 's decisions , because if you have a patient , the decisions , you say , two of them , you know , two different people , and you want to buy what to vote , the sounds of `` the less
the trick is not voice in that choice .
we actually do n't choose between education science , we choose to get between memories to experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we do n't normally do our future .
we think about our future as a result memory .
and basically , you can see , you know , as a source of the eye itself , and you can think of yourself as one of the time that the game is doing by experiences that takes not the trick .
i feel like we 're going to get this very often , often the case , we do n't to do them in the services of the game itself .
and that 's a little bit hard , i think .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
that 's one of the prediction theory that 's given for the basics of the game itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a joke that we made a few years ago in the villages , the obvious thing was the best , i had ever had , and i think most often think of how many people in other were
and i probably have my memories of my memories to this eye , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever had open the phone phone with the most remote pictures of the way , i 've spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , that 's pretty much for a hours of a hours .
there seems to be a magic issue .
now , i like a little bit very extremely , you know , how little of the memories of memories i 've got to share of memories , but even if you make more of them , there 's a real question . why do we give memories so
so i want you to think about a thought of thought .
imagine your next paper , you know , all the people will be brought up and you get a trick so that you 're not going to get to any .
well , would you choose the same sheet of a more quiet box ?
and if you 'd choose to choose another piece , there 's a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you want to decide , and that 's really really obvious to how you 're not going to think about , because
why we use the product that we choose is a problem that is about a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two species of self would have two terms from happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can use one per self .
so you can ask , how is the end itself is ?
and then they would ask you , how are the moments in life 's the game itself ?
and they 're all very lucky for the hour to have a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions of the most dinosaurs you can see ?
and , by the way , we 're now saving a good idea of happiness that happiness of itself .
when you ask the happiness itself , it 's a very different thing .
that is not a person who is happy ,
it 's like curiosity , or is it to be the person who think when the person 's person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who 's made this argument not send to the very happiness , and i 'm looking at a lot of researchers about well-being , which the research of the happiness has been put in exactly this way .
the distinction between the happiness of itself and the internet arm of the eye itself is recognized in the last few years , and now you try to measure the two of them .
the presence of organization has a global world at which over a million people asked them what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years we started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main debate of the most and the main debate we think is that they 're really different .
you can know how , `` how '' somebody with your life is , and that 's really really what really did n't teach a lot of it , how happy he lives and the other way around the other way around .
just to get a sense of the temperature that is about the temperature of the temperature of the way to get up with it .
what is that means to do that , if you 're going to meet someone , you would say , oh , his dad is a trick , how much would you know about his size ?
now , you would know something about his size , but there are a lot of uncertainty .
they have so uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone 's life on a scale has a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with the most eye self .
so the temperature of the temperature is so small .
we know what the game is safe about the game .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly , being to be head to people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there 's other ways , but it 's a problem .
so if you 're lucky to the happiness of the self , you 'll do them in the end of a very different species .
the evidence of what i said here is that we do n't really think of happiness as a 3d system .
it 's a completely different term .
now , a short reason , which we 're not clear about happiness , we do n't think of the same things we 're not looking for the same things , if we think about life , and when we actually live lives .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not the correct answer .
if you think that question , you think that people have to think , that people have to be in california , if they say , say , in groups .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about between california and other places , and that difference is , let 's say , in the climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the end itself , and it 's not even a matter for the collective itself that you 're going to be able to be happy about .
but , because the commercial self is responsible , you can get an infinite system of the creation -- you can end at the end -- some people could go at california .
and it 's very interesting to follow , which happens to people who are going to become happier to california .
now , you 're not going to be happier at yourself .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you will think that you are happier , because if you 've been thinking about it , you 're told about how awful the weather in in a period was , and you feel that you 've met the right decision
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i 'm a sense of a sense of what 's difficult to make .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we 're doing a couple of weeks ago , they started to me with me to talk about that , that it was quite interesting as a really result , which came out of these with those eye .
is this something that you can make us feel because you left a few minutes left left here ?
daniel flu : sure .
i think the most the thing that we found in the presence is a number that we really have n't been expected to find .
we found that in terms of happiness to the happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotion we saw , how do we saw the income .
and it turns out that under the income of 60,000 dollars a year for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 100 times , but it 's a big classic sample , under a income of $ 100 dollars in a year .
60,000 .
tr : october .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they 're increasingly less unhappy , the aliens will .
and we get it in the way that we get a absolutely deal line on that .
i mean , i 've seen that way as flat lines .
what happens is obviously , money is a trick to a while , but lack of money is certainly comfortable , and we can be very , very clear with very clear .
in the spirit of the other self , you get some other story .
the more money you made is the operation is .
it 's not true for emotion .
but satellite , in the entire american practice , it 's life 's being being freedom of happiness , freedom to the happiness .
if people would take that more seriously , i mean , everything seems to put it all on the head , all the things that we believe for instance , for example , in terms of us and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is going to take seriously like seriously would make politics and make politics ?
tr : you know , i think there 's smart for the role of the eye in politics .
the higgs is the very slow thing in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it 's happening right now and in other countries , it 's happening right now .
people are , they realize that happiness should be thinking when they think about politics .
it 's going to take a while , and people will predict whether they want to explore the way to explore or be able to explore the future , so we need to get a very soon soon .
as you get lucky , you can get different on your happiness , as you think and whether you think about yourself , you might think about yourself in the eye .
that 's going to be politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you 're going to be able to measure the eye of the population .
so that 's me , or two decades of the national statistics are part of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , or at least the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , just , break in all the street , right .
i 'm a journalist out i 'm a journalist . i was doing video games .
i 'm living for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as they 're in a while .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including them , more time with playing and play games .
we 're spending three billion hours a week at the moment at the moment .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
maybe much time in the way that we have sort of how many problems we need in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the center for the future is exactly the opposite of that .
three billion hours per week is not even more likely to solve the game problems of the world .
in fact , i realized that if we want to survive the next century to survive on this planet , we can go back to each time .
i have the fact i have a lot of hours of playing education games per week .
so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , so i 'll do it , so it can be a lot of it : if we 're going to solve problems like hunger , climate change , global conflict and obesity
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this image is pretty much exactly why i believe games for survival of human species are so critical to the future . seriously .
this is a portrait portrait to the day .
he wanted to be the feelings to play in play , so he 's built a camera in front of the game .
this is one of the classic figures that play .
if you 're not a player , you may be some of the components of the bubble of the bubble and you may be able to do some of the gas the gas picture .
you see , you see this sense of motivation , something is a lot of fear , but also the basic quality , really , in fact , is in the context of a real difficult problem .
you play yourself , you see some of the pieces here that you 're doing with you up to you , and you 're mouth , you 're an sign of optimism , the gender surprise .
this is a player who is on the edge of a call of a call of a call of a call of a call , `` a man 's cool '' .
oh , you know this . thank you . so we have a little player here .
an online tool is a result that is so very very different , that you do n't know it was before , that it was actually possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , you 're shocked that you 're actually able to be able to be like something . that 's a trick to a game .
and this one , a few a famous short , is to do it like a quick record .
and this is what we need to see in millions of faces from the world , if we take the status century from the next century , the face of all , the world 's thing is going on the edge of the edge of a national
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we 're difficult to look forward .
i 'm calling it `` in life , '' and it 's actually my face , and it 's what i see ? yes ? ok .
that 's what i am `` bad '' i am bad with it . ''
this is an appointment mechanism home to be in berkeley , california , where i was in my business first , why we 're better than much of the real life .
that 's a problem that many players have .
we think we 're not as good as play .
and i 'm not just successful with any other , although that 's what it 's about .
we 're going to reach more . i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , to do with the way of the way to do something about the motivation to be inspired with collaboration .
if we 're in a interview , i think a lot of us will turn into our best version , any time , we 're immediately sure that the problem is trying to solve , so long as a long , like trying to try and try to try
and reality when we 're not afraid when we put up on the ocean , we feel ourselves .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel it . we feel like it 's threatened , perhaps depressed , property or uncertainty .
we never feel that these feelings never , if we play games in play , they simply just do n't .
and that 's what i wanted to study as a student student .
why is it impossible to think , in games , you could n't get anything done everything ?
how can we make these emotions out of play in reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is a perfect environment to the current environment .
and i 've seen some things that i 've seen the ordinary shape in the way that you can do that .
so , first , if you 're going to get in one of those eyes , especially at world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to have willing to have a trick mission ,
but not just mission mission , mission to its current level of play in play , right ?
so , let 's make that .
you have never got a task you ca n't solve them .
but always on the edge of their ability , so you have to make sure . there 's no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you 're not sitting around and it 's in the morning . there 's always a whole thing to do there .
and there are many employees .
and you go out of hundreds of people who work with them to take their pictures mission .
we do n't live in the real life , that feeling of people are ready in a eye of the people who are ready .
and also , there are this kind of narrative story , which we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this positive feedback .
they 've heard from `` the level of `` `` big going up and `` the `` holy strength '' `` is `` extra intelligence . ''
this is not a typical feedback feedback , not living in the real feedback .
if i leave up this stage , i do n't have , you know , i have a disease idea , and you have a hundred crazy idea , i have an crazy idea .
i 'm not going to get on the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the eye is how world of warcraft is that it is so inspired to be able to be low on the edge of a `` open open '' that we 're going to spend our entire time .
they 're just better than reality .
so far , all the world has spent millions of years together now that are virtual problems of the eye .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it sounds like bad .
but to see it in context , millions of years ago our first step started to go to .
so the first bottle of his first papers .
ok , so if we talk about it , how much time now with play , it makes sense of when you 're going to be able to play in terms of human development , what is extremely powerful .
but also , what 's also out of is that we 're using all of these things , actually to change what we 're able to do as humans .
we 're going to be used to a whole field of all , and we 're developing it .
that 's the truth . i believe in this .
now , look at this interesting statistics that recently published from a researchers that was published by the middle months of the middle , in a very young young , in a very eye , many hours hours of the 21st , july hours .
so , 10,000 hours of hours is an incredibly interesting number of reasons that 's second .
first of all , for children in the united states , there are the most popular to spend the exact eye of that , who spend them in school , from the five grade class to high school -- if you never missing .
so here we have a whole eye now on the young people , people , to know what 's means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of obese web , `` you know . ''
so she now know his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research that if we spend 10,000 hours of having a huge deal of one more object to the 21st of one , of course , we 're going to spend to it .
we 're going to be doing so good about what most people are doing in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are now .
so the big question is , what 's a real player 's getting good , what is good ?
because if we could figure out that , we would n't have a result of human potential for human .
so many people have been in the world that we at least an hour a day with with the end of the time .
these are our eye at the face . 500 million people , the incredibly good thing in the `` something . ''
and in the next decade we have another player , extraordinary , really good in which , in fact .
you do n't have to have it , you have n't heard the way you 've heard .
the games rate to see the energy , save energy and work to work , instead of how to play with the world , especially in india , china , brazil .
you 'd expect to be a extra billion player in the next decade .
we have an billion player in this .
so i started to think about what it 's like to do these games .
here are four things that i found . first , in first .
ok , imagine how the extreme do go .
so , this is what to do is to do something to manage a face , working with the belief that we have a random hope to have success .
players believe that a game of communication is possible , and it 's always being a way to try it and the same .
you 're sitting in your not .
so you are in your players are skin skin social nets .
there 's a lot of more interesting research that shows we have people who are playing them , even if they have that , we have bad programs .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with somebody 's game .
we trust that someone else compared to the rules that we 're going to have the same goal and to the road road .
so the way that is now allowed the web growing on perspective , trust and each other .
we build more social social relationships .
all productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's one reason , why the game of the show is 22 hours a week , in the end of the way you 're doing it .
the reason is that when we play , we actually are happier about , we 're working , as if we 're going to be hungry or anything .
we know that we work as human beings , if we do very hard , doing some hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , the things and the most meaning .
so players are going to love this to be a little bit part of the eye to the eye .
here , the eye to turn on the right , you know , all wikipedia , the largest 30 in the world .
the second largest part of the world with almost nearly smooth , is the world of warcraft 's .
five million people are using it every month .
they have more information on world of warcraft of warcraft of warcraft of warcraft , as much different things in each other 's point in the world .
they create a separate story .
they 're creating a remote source of knowledge over the world of warcraft .
so , ok , so that 's four to one that are one thing to one you are , players , the windows individuals .
it 's people who believe that they can change the world as a single way to change the world .
and the only problem is you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real worlds .
that 's the problem i 'm trying to solve .
now , have you have an idea with a trick .
his work is a great genius . he study why people have been so much time , energy and money .
and he says , `` we 're not going to do less than not less than a game in virtual worlds and it '' ''
and that 's an economist , so it 's sense .
and he says ...
not as i am -- i think i think , in fact , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , probably , i 'm living , i 'm a
so he says , really , makes sense of that , because players can reach more to the real life .
you can be used in play social leone than you are different than real life , and you get more feedback and reward in play than in real life .
so he says , it 's really the way that the players in the virtual world is when they spend the actual world .
i 'm only going to say it 's sense . that 's sense .
but it 's definitely definitely a trick .
we need to start to turn real world into a game .
my inspiration from a event , which is a event , 100 years ago .
there 's these ancient palm company , and there 's this secret way of eye . you know ?
and this fantastic game gave you a game game .
and so that was the first thing we 've been developed to do with people .
and if you 're familiar with the middle of the old people who are familiar to the old eye of the old world , you may know that story . the story about how and why games have invented .
you 're going to be like games , you 're in , you know , in the kingdom , there was invented during a famine 's [ famine .
now , think of a great famine , the king of the eye is to go to an crazy idea .
people are getting it down . people fail .
it was a brilliant situation . you needed a brilliant solution .
so , according to you , loud is the eye , and then in turn a national strategy , you would turn with food .
and you would be able to get into the eye there , there are so fascinating , and with learning , you know , productivity , to productivity , they would forget there were nothing to eat .
and then the next day , they would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to men , they were spending so 18 to survive those days , they were eating at a day and they played on the next .
and that 's how i think , let 's play games today .
we 're going to put games to get the suffering of the real world .
we 're not using them all to identify ourselves in the real world , all of the real life is not about , and we 'll get us to do what we need to play .
but this does n't have to be that the end .
that 's exciting .
so , according to 18 , the man was not a better , and so the king king , a happy game is dangerous .
you shared the box in two , you shared the box .
they played a interview and the winner to a common adventure .
they left the interview , and they 're looking at looking at new school . they 're just doing so many people , and they were looking at the poster to a little one of them to survive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest trick show that the game that go on the most vulnerable , the same dna as the old eye is .
so scientists recently had recently been recently that they actually are crazy history .
and then , by looking at evidence of evidence of a global amount of global breast , almost 20 years to know what could be the most popular explain .
so this crazy story could respond .
you may have saved your people with play by having an 18 years in games and then learned these moments , and so much about the various people to learn they 're saved all the civilization .
so , we can also , too .
we have to play in 1994 since we 've been in 1994 .
this was the first in real time the world of the face of the world 's first game , that was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years , we 've been playing in 16 years of world .
i 'm saying we 're ready for our own , play .
so , she sent half of their civilization on looking for a new world , and so i 'm going to take my 21 billion share a week a week .
we should be talking about teenagers that half of us spend an hour a day , until we 've solved the problems of the real world .
i know you 're asking , `` how do we solve problems of real world ? '' and exactly of the question i 've got to do my work in the last years to the
we have this article in our office in our office , it 's sort of open out of how we need to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is we create the future .
we want to introduce the best thing that we want to imagine , and then we just give people to make this notion that reality .
we put it a little bit more sophisticated and give people the ability to achieve it .
i 'll show you very few three games that i designed trying to make and make the remote feature in their own future .
this is `` world of the world . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a search in a room where you need to get a trick .
the food is invented , but we have enough to make it happen to be , and they actually live their lives without oil , and then you have to figure out how to have the power of your life , and you have to find them to create
we were working with this game with the eye in 2007 , and we 've been able to have on over the last three years since last time .
and i can tell you , it was a change of experience .
nobody wants to change your life because it 's good for the environment , because we should .
but if you 're in a text adventure , and you 'll say , `` we go , `` we go . ''
that 's a fascinating adventure you can go on .
find the way they 're survive , most of our players have given up to the game .
so we have a bigger game game for the next eye in the next eye , and we used to take a difference in the end of the time that is the end of the game .
we developed the game on the center for the future .
the point is that the battery of the trick is that people only left 23 years on the planet .
this is the global global game , of course .
the call in the player , to sign , we have almost to be designed for `` with this . ''
you know , you know , in the dolphins , you can see , you 're . you know , where it `` you know '' -- you have the creation of the creation , the scientists , the one , just save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say everybody is in the business , and it 's our job for energy for energy , food , security and the future of social justice .
so , vitamin players played this in the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they read , if they google `` eye '' .
and the last game will bring three , on the three . it 's a game collaboration with collaboration with the world bank .
if you go to play in the game , you get off the world bank , the so-called world bank , you get to the social eye , and it 's got in 2010 .
we 're working with universities in all africa and we 're making it to social access to build social to come .
we have a gift about this . we have a gift . we have a big up to see , the sustainability , sustainability , vision and general theory .
i all want to share the game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in the game that is suffering , and they imagine their own social social structures to save the world .
i am going to finish now .
i want to ask something questions .
what do you think it 's going to happen to be next ?
we have all of these fantastic players , we play games to show us what we can do , but we 're not real world .
well , i hope you are the way that your players are human resources , we can use the work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have these all these results , the ideas , the ability to be able to provide deeply , deeply social social nets , and the desire to do with the challenge .
i really hope that we play some of the games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you 'll design these play and play play .
and if i go to the next decade , i 'm sure that we can create any way to create a lot in a way that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let 's play games !
thank you .
i would like to tell you something that i was in a few months in front of me a trip for the time that 's ever been done with the time .
i always spent my eye writing , but i was finished with the paper , and i realized that i never have a while of my life , which means the word `` the minister . ''
i read you the pen .
`` a filmmaker , the economist , a hundred , ben , a way , a little bit , a little bit , a common , common , the eye of traffic , '' and the software , done , to go out , is also hurt , is
suppose : healthy , strong , etc . ''
i have a friend of a friend loud to read , and i had to be like , it was like that way , but i just got to go up until the head and could n't stop and i had to stop , and i would go through
of course , that was a trick , old eye . i just thought that the copy had been pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early '80s when i started to have a student in school and started to build my decision outside of my family project and shapes my mind in other children and the rest of the rest of the rest of
and god did thank much a time back .
would i be a serious seriously seriously , if i was born in a world that would be someone like a person , whose life can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
so i immediately immediately , the voice of 2009 , and i would find out what i 'm going to do is that the game of the character .
here 's the smell version of this that we 're doing .
unfortunately , she 's not a lot better .
in particular , my last two words , i think , `` in the parking eye security '' and they 're all how healthy and healthy and healthy .
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about humans , we describe to our words .
it 's about the values in these words , and how we design these values .
our language are influenced to our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the societies , including the child and the child 's child and the science , really believed that the only force of a game has a big force because the things that you 're doing is to go to you .
so , what do we really want to be -- you want to get people like a powerful people , or a powerful people ?
just to give a person alone as a child , could be a child , and they were able to be able to share them in the same time .
would n't it be nice to open on your doors ?
a person who has opened me on the fire , was my accident at the time .
he 's called dr. contact . it 's a trick that name the name , as you can think , most americans could n't be correct , he was called dr. martin 's name , `` was called the name of the
and dr. `` alex '' was always a stone fly , and was just a work for work with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just as well , just until the eye .
i had to make a lot of reference , a lot more and far , to make a 3d game -- in different colors -- i had to build them to take you , and i feel these back more than anything else . i hated them . i
and imagine , i 've even been able to stop a game with dr. service , so to stop this practice , without success .
and one day he 's watching me at an mathematical puzzle -- the evidence were just brilliant and lower -- and he said , `` wow , '' you 're just a strong , young and a young girl , you 're going to be a day
and if you can , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was just a simple trick of dr. frustration , so i make the symptoms that i did n't want to do with the view of the world 's democratic conflict in the second floor , but he was actually able to see my daily voice with new eyes
and i wonder how much his vision of me have come to very strong and cheap young girl is up my behavior , and i could imagine myself as a different from nature from strong , powerful , and the answer to see .
it 's just one example of many , how adults are able to do is to take the imagination of a child .
but how do you prove that we 've had to prove that this way of making examples of the eye , we do n't want to make our language in the eye , which can imagine what we would like to do , and it would be any individual
our language is given the social changes in many cases through a technology .
from the medical game , of course you can say that my legs , the presence of a time , with me to develop more and artificial analysis for more and artificial analysis for the natural body that you can do , to have your own identity , to
so perhaps what happens is that the technological changes that the technological changes that the technology industry that there was always another truth , which , every human human human society can be able to have something that we have something very well and the human ability to be
human ability to adapt -- that 's an interesting story because people always tell me what i would be with , and i 'm going to be a little bit of the idea that i 'm never going to be asking me , and i think , i 'm
this sentence 's sentence in the form of the imagination with not to develop an idea that success or happiness of it is to get a challenge to become more challenging to it , as if my life would be so successful , because i could be able to
but the truth is that we change it . of course , we 're in the challenge , whether they 're physical , emotional , or even the two .
and i want that that is good .
not not be a smartphone that we have to get to see a way we can be able to get to life .
so , you can just live in language .
and i 've been afraid to see it as my shadows .
sometimes i get a very heart on , sometimes he 's not too seeing , but he 's always on me .
and i want to make so far that the impact , the very heavy part of a people who will give us the people .
there are personal health and challenges , and they are just the ones 's eye , and every person is different , but the question does n't matter whether we 're actually able to get better than not , but not as we can
so we 're not just just responsible for people to keep out before , but to touch it in order to get good with that .
and we do n't even do our children like we have to have to have them if we give them the feeling that they ca n't adapt .
you have to realize two things , to one that are in one medical fact , and you have to be an medical fact , and to other people 's social opinion , whether i 'm a vacuum or not .
and to be honest , the only real and more expensive , to the more expensive person i had to get apart with , is that the world says all of it , they can describe me with this
in our desire to protect people to protect the heart , and we think hard hard to learn hard , the truth of their medical plan or even a plan to the quality that they expect , we would n't get our life for that someone actually is to
maybe the question is , it 's just as a gas gas network , which is in a broken , and as we fix the way , every single one of each individual has a larger disability than the atoms in the atoms itself .
if we do n't treat a person , and i do n't know all his forces and the opportunities and they 're able to hear , and they 're able to be able to make ourselves all the natural struggle to them to lead another disease .
we 're making a human one of being worth one for our society .
so we have to look at the eye , and we have to focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but the very important thing is that it 's between perception of our health and our great natural discoveries , a connection .
we should not be able to just get these very , or about the very , or about a presentation , we do n't have try to avoid them , we should still be able to avoid them under the carpet , but it 's about to see the
i 'm going to be a bit more about it , to imagine that we do n't necessarily believe that , but we 're open for it , it 's open to it , to actually give them up to dance as a trick , and maybe even it
and we may be able to do better than anything natural , places and useful , feel like their presence , no longer beat us that way .
this year , we 're in this year , and when it wrote about 150 years ago , 150 years ago , darwin has been , in my eyes , in a very real real true character in human character .
i would like to talk about these words : not the most part of its way , and also not the presence of its way , but that 's really that the changes of the best way to adapt .
it 's a little creativity to creativity .
not just from modern work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and fashion , from the human spirit of the human spirit has been safe to keep through conflict .
so again , change and neuroscience are the great skills of people .
and we might only know from which are we that we 're being focused in , if we really get to get off .
perhaps it may be the exact sense of adults , a sense of a learning , a sense of our power for our own power .
we can do something about ourselves .
we can be able to do better to make a new meaning out about more and more important times .
maybe we can think of as well as change as we can see .
so saving language is a change where we have n't gotten to feel at yet .
i think the biggest damage that we have a lot of self have a privilege to believe that we should be normal .
well , who is normal ?
there is no normal one .
there 's the usual level . that 's the typical thing . but it 's not the normal thing . and if you 're going to learn these poor , gray person , you want to know if you really want to know ?
i think it does n't think so .
it would be great if we could find this paradigm to the landscape of the possibilities or the strength , to even have a little dangerous tool for the fact that we can get on the forces of very many children , and they 've taught that their whole
so you 've found that we have always to do people of our society at the society , and they always have a set of a set , useful to be a sense of and we 'll afford to afford a coffee .
there might be evidence that the pollution is about , 60 years ago , 60,000 people and people with their heavy physical members of these things , and perhaps , because the situation of this people who was valuable .
they do n't study these people as a broken and violent land , they were being treated as something special and valuable .
i went a few years ago in the city , in the city of this , `` red life '' in the house of pennsylvania , and i 'm there a game in the house .
it was summer and i had a voice trick .
and i hear how a guy says , `` well , if that 's not a very popular thing is n't that . ''
and i 'm going to get around and see this older man , i had no idea what he 's said .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , do n't know what you remember to you . ''
and he said , `` well , she 's not going to remember me about me .
when i first saw her , i 've got her out of the mother . ''
oh , so the one .
and of course , it 's made of the sound .
this was dr. software , a man i only knew from the mother on my mother 's mother , because i had had a very typical company to my birthday had two weeks .
the doctor for me for a shepherd was on my mother , and i knew my parents who got me who was going to put me to the world , at the same .
and because i was born without the eye , and my feet was being released , and i just had some toes in this and a few toes , at the one , the time that i was the trick , that strangers had to be the bad news
he said to me , `` i had to say your parents who never would walk , and never to be as `` police , '' and never never was to be as many kids as if other kids were able to be able to be able to live
really , i found that he was raised with a childhood where of all childhood was raised , whether i was in a while of the second class , i was in the presence of life , whether i was doing my mouth or to have some of my
and he called this part of his eye factor , the potential of human devices .
you ca n't not trained enough of how critical of the quality of life can be .
and dr. eyes told him , he said , `` i learned that kids , if they told you they wo n't be told something else , and even if they get a little bit of support if they 're doing kids , then children can achieve much of
see , dr. laughter may be the change .
he was understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone we 're going to be , two different things are .
and also , i 've changed my thinking of time if you asked me about 15 years , whether i had been being able to use my clients against meat and bone , i would have had a second .
i was so much indeed , at the time .
if you ask me today today , i 'm not quite sure .
and that 's what happens because i had experienced a bit with my legs and not even in the experiences .
and maybe that change could happen , because i 've been able to have the person to have the way that they did that they have to face , rather than people who were being turned on me or an idea of the idea of the doors .
you see , it 's really just going to really have to be a human being showing them , how you can get your forces , and they 're through .
if you make someone make their own , your own forces , your own forces -- the human spirit -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment a door , you 're a very good teacher for these people .
they 're bringing them to open the doors to open the doors .
the real meaning of `` eye '' is `` eye '' in the word box .
it means that it means something that is in one you 're , the potential for that .
again , that 's what the potential is we going to want to talk about ?
in the '60s , in the '60s , in a way , there were one online . there was a way there was this trick in a place .
they call this `` do this be `` quiet eye '' in the united states , which is what we call this `` warm . ''
students become a little bit ahead .
and the one students will go through harder to a lot , get better teachers ,
you then , you know , you have a bad time of students who gave up a `` star '' the `` very good '' -- it was said to them , they are in the order that they were very smart , and after these three months ,
and of course , and of course , it turns out it 's a heart that the other way the other is said , it 's only enough .
and that 's when it was , the three months were too .
but only the ones who still were in school -- except from the students who had the school .
the key thing that teachers were n't getting out of it .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
so they just became , in fact , that if you 're the kid and you 're going to be the students who are , and the students are in the early news . and they 're just learning to them .
the only real disability is a matter of mind a mind that has been broken , did n't find hope . it 's nothing more beautiful , and it 's not natural , soft curiosity . and our favorite ability to the imagination .
but if we do , human minds , too , to help hope to hope , to hope , to find and other people around them , we really are using our forces to do our forces .
if a spirit of the adult is about the other , we can create new reality and new skills .
i would like to end with a poem that was writing from a piece of a piece of eye in the 14 century , and i 've been told by my friend 's name with my friend 's name , and the poem is called `` the god ,
come on the dance with me . thank you very much .
