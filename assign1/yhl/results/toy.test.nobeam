so steve voices , performance of the los angeles times , a day from los streets , he went to a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a common , engineer , homeless , homeless , who played on a rock that was only like two years .
many of you will know the story because it 's been a book later that i was a book , and again , that was a film , and that was an easy thing , with robert , was a steve , steve , and still , as a
solly went to the running left , and i went to the interview and 30 years later , he lived as memory in the center of los angeles .
i 'm very much to read all of you to read the book , or to look at the movie so that you do n't just have the wonderful things between these two men , but also how the music was to make this connection and how you would
i met frank school with two years ago , in the effect of disney hall .
he just had a fan of street first and global steel heard behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very business , and he was talking to sound about al fields and la clinton and the prime clinton and talking about how the air could never make it happen into the golden world , and that all the time that is because of the
we came to speak with music . and a few days later , i got an email in which we 'd think that was interested in a time of myself .
i have to mention even that the medical treatment was focused on , because it was already used with the test and it had been treated with the eye and it 's treated , a brilliant player that had taken it all the whole life .
now , as a result , he 's particularly unique for these cybercriminals , and they 're sometimes bad , and he 's talking about six days , in the streets of a eye , and the people 's mind , and the people 's mind are going to
and in fact , in that same thing , it was focused on the way that we started with our first day of the effect sky online , he was just started to have just lost his eyes in his eyes and just lost .
he was talking about invisible hall and smoke and about it , like someone wanted to go to sleep in their sleep .
i had scared , but i was afraid that he could destroy him in the world , and i could destroy him with the company to the company , when i started to talk about the presence and the game and other ,
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first sentence of the first sentence .
and while i was playing , i was afraid that in the eyes of a full kind of thing went to change .
it was like he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose game was my game .
so you 're looking at anger , in terms of a mechanical curiosity and dry .
and like a miracle took his apartment and started to play some of the eye , and asked me to play , to play , you know , okay , the game .
and we started talking about music , from the presence of the presence of fashion , right , and all the other dimensions , are from making up to the place .
and i realized that he was not just a magical knowledge about music , but it also had a heavy relationship with her well .
he talked about her , with her passion and one of the understanding , i 'm just going to know from my colleagues in the edge of los angeles .
by being asked music and she talked about music , i was talking about this at this point , to the man who was moved to the streets of los angeles , a computer game , the software , the same , in eastern a
music is medicine . music changing us .
for any ways , music music got off and well , health .
because the music allows him to get him and the promise and the promise of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and he 's doing the standard of his united states .
and i understood that this is exactly the most art of art .
so this is exactly why we make music music : so we do something that is in the inside of our feelings , in our sense , through our artistic lens through our creativity to reality .
and reality is the word word , all of us , moving us , inspired and we get it .
what 's a lot of death 's talk about music took him back to a community of friends .
the eye 's force took him back to a family of the geese who understood his talent thought , and looked at it in .
and i 'm going to play and then again , whether in the impact 's way to go up , or in the mind , you know , he reminds me why i am a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert means .
robert : i do want to play something i have with the farmer .
i hope you guys agree .
so i knew many fish in my life .
i have only two loved loved ] that .
this first , which was more like a boring accident .
it was a beautiful fish , the software , good , good brand , the one blue on the toilet mass .
what a fish do n't do .
and better better , he was in the end of the most largest dimensions of sustainability .
so you could feel about it , so you could get to sell it .
i had a beauty had a relationship over several months .
and one day , the head of the company called the company , asked if i could have a event of being a event about the sustainability of the farm .
`` of course , i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this product problem has been for our native , how do we train fish on our own ?
in the last 50 years , we have as we have more effective as we were doing forests .
it 's hard to cover the destruction to cover .
90 percent of the great fish who we love , the average , the ones the ones , the ones , the ones , the ones , they were collapsed .
there 's almost no more left left .
so , or bad is there , the game is part of our future .
many people go to . they 're fighting the environment , most of them , and they are in the gas , they take clean down . a big deal .
he has one of the eye from the 15 .
that means 15 pounds of fish needed so to get a tree .
not very sustainable .
also not very good at all .
so here 's one company , and that was trying to make it really too .
i was wearing it .
and the day , i had called the head of the birth of the birth to the cloud of the birth .
let 's call it to him .
`` upwake '' i said , `` only to have the way that you are famous for all far from the sea there is not these environment , you do n't create the environment . ''
`` right , '' he said , `` that 's what he said , there we are out of it that the waste will be distributed by our fish , not focused . ''
and then he 's going , `` we 're basically a personal world .
so you can get this knowledge from the eye , and he said he said .
`` the best in industry . ''
let 's go to one , great , great .
let 's go on what you 're ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' said .
`` great '' i said . put up .
and this evening i got in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before i was before , i called a little bit , i called a little bit ,
i said , `` k , what are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said she did n't . he 's going to go to go to .
now , i 'm looking at some people in the company , no one could give me a three-dimensional answer , and i finally started to finally set up the board of the lake .
let 's also call it a little bit more uncomfortable .
`` yo '' i said , `` what 's sustainable proteins ? ''
now , he mentioned some of the slides and some of the eye , and then he said , `` get a result .
i said , `` you 're on right ? ''
he said , `` yes , the driver , skin , break , to food . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your food food have chicken ? ''
in the condition of maybe two percent .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` k , what is sustainable to feed chicken in fish ? ''
there was a long time in the tea and he said , `` there are just too much chicken in the world . ''
i am doing that fish from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a trick and make it .
and that was me , too .
no , i actually have a trick from this fish , because i am playing fish with this conversation to see chicken after chicken .
this second fish , it 's a different kind of a favorite kind of a favorite .
it 's romantic species , the way you see , you know , you 're learning your fish , you 're going to love the fish more .
i first have eaten him in a restaurant .
one of the time has talked for a long fish for a long time .
it 's a kind of kind of light .
he came on the table with a light , almost a very strange white white ,
the chef had a match .
stop twice .
