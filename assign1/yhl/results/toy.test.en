one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an african-american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and i 'm telling a story that many of you know , because steve 's columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert downey jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
nathaniel dropped out of juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles .
i encourage all of you to read steve 's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you 'll pardon the pun -- in helping nathaniel get off the streets .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance of beethoven 's first and fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven 's fourth symphony .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of skid row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel 's eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
and nathaniel 's manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , sibelius .
and we started talking about music , from bach to beethoven and brahms , bruckner , all the b 's , from bart√≥k , all the way up to esa-pekka salonen .
and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard-trained musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we 're able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and for nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and i will always make music with nathaniel , whether we 're at walt disney concert hall or on skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i 'm going to play something that i shamelessly stole from cellists .
so , please forgive me .
so , i 've known a lot of fish in my life .
i 've loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i 'd speak at an event about the farm 's sustainability .
`` absolutely , '' i said .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
it 's hard to overstate the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they 've collapsed .
there 's almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they 're inefficient . take tuna , a major drawback .
it 's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it does n't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of p.r . for the company .
let 's call him don .
`` don , '' i said , `` just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you do n't pollute . ''
`` that 's right , '' he said . `` we 're so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . ''
and then he added , `` we 're basically a world unto ourselves .
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , '' he said .
`` best in the business . ''
2.5 to one , great .
`` 2.5 what ? what are you feeding ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , `` don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he did n't know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biologist .
let 's call him don too .
`` don , '' i said , `` what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
i said , `` chicken pellets ? ''
he said , `` yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . ''
i said , `` what percentage of your feed is chicken ? ''
thinking , you know , two percent .
`` well , it 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` don , what 's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? ''
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , `` there 's just too much chicken in the world . ''
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because i 'm some self-righteous , goody-two shoes foodie .
i actually am .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swear to god , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
this second fish , it 's a different kind of love story .
it 's the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
the chef had overcooked it .
like twice over .
