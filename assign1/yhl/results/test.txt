you know , one of the big eye in travel , and one of the desire to the presence is research together with people that are still asking on the old days , and that 's what the past feel like , they 're still going to be rocks
just the knowledge still still get away beyond the way , or the meaning of the world 's meaning of civil emissions is full of the time , or in the context of the way the breath is still the breath of the eye , the idea of the
and of course we are sharing the same ones .
we 're all born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through the face .
we need to tell ourselves by the time through death , and we should not surprise to us that we all sing and dance and make art .
but what 's interesting is the unique internet rainforest of the consumer group , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and it does n't matter whether it 's about the eye in the forests of plastic matter or the windows in haiti , the eye in the field , or a voice in the middle of the time , where i 've been left with a second month in
and all of these people teach us that there are other people who are going to be the other ways of thinking , other ways of state on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , one of hope .
the tumor cultures , the world 's net , a net of the web and virtual life that 's the earth and the earth 's as important as the biological ones that are doing as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural eye game , the people can imagine the air mountains of all the thoughts and dreams , as the ones , with wars and the plants , who have been designed by human imagination since the world 's history has been built , are
the eye is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's a symbol of what we are , and we 're as amazing as amazing species , and we 're able to do it in the species .
and just like the biosphere were being cut away with the biosphere , this is happening with the eye -- just by any larger speed .
no square a monkey would say to be a little bit of an example , that 50 percent or more species of all species in the kitchen of the kitchen , because it 's just not right right right now , and yet this -- the online eye is
and the key part is the city in languages .
when each of you were born in this room , we 've talked about the earth 's massive languages .
now , a language is not just the number of a vacuum or a series of the eye .
language is a expression of the human mind .
it 's a means that the soul will find access to the world of the material world .
every language is a game of the mind , a thought of a thought , an ecosystem 's mental possibilities .
and from these high languages , we 're going to sit here in monterey , and half the half of them are n't in the ears , in the ears , in the same side of children .
you 're not going to be learning , that means nothing is being done , you 're actually dead .
what could be a more being being able to be as being a late `` the last `` the last '' '' to be to be one of the last hand that talk to your language , not a possibility of being able to expect the wisdom of the
and yet , you get this terrible destiny in a little bit somewhere somewhere in the earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , every two weeks , the last is the last eye of an old language with the molecules .
and i know some of you say that , `` is n't it better to me ? '' about the world , is n't a better place if we all only going to talk to you a language ? '' and i say , `` well , this language
let 's be your own . ''
and then suddenly they can see what it would be like if they could do their own language .
so i want to talk to you a journey of today today , with a short journey , with the way to try to try to try to make them respond to you , which was actually lost .
now , there 's some of us that have been forget that i say , if i say , `` different ways , '' really different ways of what my story is mine .
take this child in the middle of the southern amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they 're doing the presence of the east from the board of apollo services .
this is a people which not invented between color blue and green , because that 's the end of the forest , that people are on , the eye is
you have a more intelligent language , and you called the most popular eye on the time called : you have to marry someone who talks another language .
all of this is the most recent past , the gap in these big houses , where the majority of six or seven languages are talking , is that you never hear somebody who is learning to be a language .
they 're just listening to speak and talk .
or , one of the most famous tribes i 've ever lived , the eye in the house , a amazing people , the first one in the year of four , the first time .
in the year , five and five , five brothers go to and made a great mistake .
they were flying sophisticated pictures from the air , and what we would like to do as was the sort of gesture of death , and they decided that these people from the rainforest has never seen some eye in their life .
they 're turning these photographs from the forest floor , and tried to see the face or the character , did n't find any of this to be the dna and killed the five brothers with the production .
but the interaction are not just outside of the outside of the world 's energy .
they 're doing each other .
now , the typical of the deaths are left with you .
we started back to the presence of eight generations of , and we found two cases of the natural death , and when we 're doing people who were a nuclear death about a map of it , they were become a world that was being so old ,
but at the same time , they had a clear fan of the forest that was amazing .
their civil civil rights could have the roofs of a animal from 40 feet of 40 , and to determine what the species of this was .
the early at the early end of years , i got a really amazing job when my professor was in harvard , whether i was interested in haiti and the secret societies of the strength , which was the foundation of the strength of the food and to make
to give this a sense of having a sense of giving a sense of this job , of course , something about the most remarkable faith that knowledge and dolphins is n't going to be a window of the black magic .
the opposite , it 's a complex light issue .
it 's interesting .
if i was asking you , the big economy of time , what would you say ?
th , islam , leo , is always the same thing , whatever .
a continent is always left left because the rare rate was that there are no religious faith in africa , and of course , there 's an idea of the very common religious thought that are the world 's
but what 's so interesting is that it is this space relationship between living and dead .
the living gave the script .
the indus script , in the great water , are to be in the large water , the answers to the rhythm of the dance to map the soul of the living room so that the game will be for a short player moment to god .
so , they 're like to say that the game likes to be , `` you know , you go to church and you like to god .
we dance in the jungle and become god 's god . ''
and because , they 're obsessed , you are going to reach off the spirit . how can you be being being able to make you get smarter ?
you see this amazing joke : you 're in a 3d store , and you see , there 's black coal without a amazing version of the ability of the ability of the mind that the body will affect the body , that this is when it 's going
now , from all the people i met , were the fbi 's memory , from the sierra mountain , the most mountain people 's mind , the most powerful .
so from the old eye civilization , the presence of the eye are diagnosed from working on columbia side of the way that they 're in a while of their people in the eye , which a german unit of a sudden smoking .
in a eye continent , these people were never been paid by the eye .
so , to a year today , you 're going to look at a plane 's a plane , the education education , but the education education is very extraordinary .
the young is going to the age of three and four years from their families and in a kind of black world , where the average of the glacier is on the age of 18 , and two times of each nine years -- two times from every nine
and during this whole time , you 're used to get into the values of your society , values that keep your mind your email and only , just your email , the most common -- we could say the green -- to keep the
at the end of this amazing neighborhood , you 're all of a sudden you get outside , in your life , in the age of 18 , you see a one , and in this moment of the first time of consciousness , when the sun starts to
it 's wonderful . you must protect it . ''
they call the older brothers , and say we 're the problem and the destruction of the world for the destruction of the world .
now , the level of that is very important .
and once we think about something and landscape we 're either thinking , and then we put the old president of the great prize of the great wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild
so , some other , some things are not a resource , you 're still going to get off your neighbor .
there 's no longer much place in the eye or the cold effect of bus , but yet , in time and a , of a powerful , a powerful game of the earth , not at the idea of her being being aware of , but to be
now , what does that mean ?
it means a little child out of the rubber hole that believe in the mind , the mountain is a trick , which is his or her own destiny , is a whole different person , and a little relationship to this kind of place that you can get
whether he 's a head of mind or a bunch of voice , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor is the metaphor that 's defined between the individual between nature .
i grew up in the forests of the golden park and i believed that these forests are there to be able to be able to be there .
this is what it made me to a different people , and i think that these forests think of the eye of the eye and the computer is the open to the eye , the most online , the most online thing , which they would be in their
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different features , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like , that plant .
it 's a picture i just touched last of the last april in the middle of the amazon .
this is the computer model , which has heard a lot of you , the powerful basic goods from the definition of the sea .
what 's so fascinating does n't make just that the trick of the eye is , but its ability to be in a whole page , and on one side , there is a series of the eye , the eye , and the eye on smoke , it
these whales have some very strong software that are the blood place , and they are very similar to them .
if you 've seen the eye , how you 've seen that stuff , these pieces , which you 've done from different ways to make it be more at the different ways .
so to actually fly this way , it 's about being able to be able to be able to be cut out of the end of a eye , and the highway on a sea of electricity .
it 's not going to be produced in reality , it 's going to be the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor richard richard , richard squared , who who were the chief eye in mexico in mexico , about this , about this , and i said that these are not as a vacuum device , because that 's where the effects you would
but the thing with the eye is they can not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able through one in the human being the name of it , they 're going to be able to be able to be
you can only put in terms of connection with some other chemicals that the dark ones are doing .
so what fascinating is that the game in the online industry are the same part of the way that is necessary to get the end , so ask itself .
how can these people from a generation of the small species of the plants are not able to find these two , or to plants that , if they do n't have the way that they do , a kind of `` the `` kind of thing , ''
we use this great chinese chinese , and try and mistakes what is going to be done as a research study .
but if you ask the indians , she 's like , `` the plant talks to us . ''
so , what does that mean ?
this is the tribe that has 17 different property of the sound that you all seem seen in a very large distance , that you see in the forest for our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how she 's treated your own fat , and you say , `` i thought you know some of the plants .
i mean , you know nothing , right ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that you take every one of the 17 things on the world 's disease and you sing to them sing a different bamboo ball .
now , this is no idea of you , no bridge in harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting than having a game .
now , the point is that , even those of us , are able to protect schools that are able to protect the hard way to the hard and the crowd , but in the people , they 're kind of the past , as the real world ,
so , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , 300 years or technical innovations , but as in the age of the biological and cultural diversity , the whole diversity of biological and cultural diversity are either being done in the earth , so that 's
all cultures have gone down to the dance with new skills .
and the problem is not the technology .
the game did n't have to be less at the age of being less at the meeting , when they did n't know the bow and the body of tasks when americans were being stopped americans , when they were a horse and they 're doing tasks .
not change and technology for some technology to the end of the eye . it 's power , the most basic face of atoms .
and where you 're going to be in the world , you 'll find that these cultures are not the world 's online world , and they 're dynamic , their existence , by the way , they 're in the front of the time , a trick ,
or if we go to the mountains of nigeria , i used to see much more work , and see the sound of the political bomb .
you know , the fourth of the genocide , which is based on human beings , but the trick , the destruction of the people , is not just civil , but in general , is n't a part of a eye .
and you can not understand the suffering when you 've experienced it .
i 've been looking at a young colleagues with a young colleagues , and i was looking for the eye for the eye and only when i was looking for the face of whom you hear -- fresh holy organic bodies that were turned in to the poor and
and my father was forced to this young lama as a foundation of the crime ,
that meant that he killed during the chinese cancer immediately .
his uncle 's uncle , with her sons , to the site that people brought up to rock .
his mother became in love for -- for the crime of the crime ,
he was in the age of two years of prison to hide under her the end , because they could n't live without it .
the sister who did n't create these eye , became a trick .
and then , one day she was left out on a hospital and it had to make them into seven years into seven years .
the suffering of suffering can be down , but the game 's mind is something that is something so far .
and at the end , we really are a choice in front of this , and if we do in a very eye 's world or a third world 's a crime world of the diversity of life ?
now , margaret game , who told the great budget said it was their most fear of fear , that while we 're going to move in the direction of a toy , we 're just just just the whole range of human imagination in the eye thinking ,
and it 's based on to think that our species may have been there for the last one .
the game revolution that got us to the agriculture , and we have to make ourselves a moment of the `` and the poetry of these images through these regions of marine houses and the hierarchy , and the courage created -- found 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world we know about is an 300 years old .
now , that little story , i do n't tell me that we all have the answers to the challenges that we are in the next way to be in the next way .
if we 're doing this tumor to the importance of people , the answer to ca
