you know , one of the big eye in travel , and one of the desire to the presence is research together with people that are still asking on the old days , and that 's what the past feel like , they 're still going to be rocks
just the knowledge still still get away beyond the way , or the meaning of the world 's meaning of civil emissions is full of the time , or in the context of the way the breath is still the breath of the eye , the idea of the
and of course we are sharing the same ones .
we 're all born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through the face .
we need to tell ourselves by the time through death , and we should not surprise to us that we all sing and dance and make art .
but what 's interesting is the unique internet rainforest of the consumer group , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and it does n't matter whether it 's about the eye in the forests of plastic matter or the windows in haiti , the eye in the field , or a voice in the middle of the time , where i 've been left with a second month in
and all of these people teach us that there are other people who are going to be the other ways of thinking , other ways of state on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , one of hope .
the tumor cultures , the world 's net , a net of the web and virtual life that 's the earth and the earth 's as important as the biological ones that are doing as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural eye game , the people can imagine the air mountains of all the thoughts and dreams , as the ones , with wars and the plants , who have been designed by human imagination since the world 's history has been built , are
the eye is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's a symbol of what we are , and we 're as amazing as amazing species , and we 're able to do it in the species .
and just like the biosphere were being cut away with the biosphere , this is happening with the eye -- just by any larger speed .
no square a monkey would say to be a little bit of an example , that 50 percent or more species of all species in the kitchen of the kitchen , because it 's just not right right right now , and yet this -- the online eye is
and the key part is the city in languages .
when each of you were born in this room , we 've talked about the earth 's massive languages .
now , a language is not just the number of a vacuum or a series of the eye .
language is a expression of the human mind .
it 's a means that the soul will find access to the world of the material world .
every language is a game of the mind , a thought of a thought , an ecosystem 's mental possibilities .
and from these high languages , we 're going to sit here in monterey , and half the half of them are n't in the ears , in the ears , in the same side of children .
you 're not going to be learning , that means nothing is being done , you 're actually dead .
what could be a more being being able to be as being a late `` the last `` the last '' '' to be to be one of the last hand that talk to your language , not a possibility of being able to expect the wisdom of the
and yet , you get this terrible destiny in a little bit somewhere somewhere in the earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , every two weeks , the last is the last eye of an old language with the molecules .
and i know some of you say that , `` is n't it better to me ? '' about the world , is n't a better place if we all only going to talk to you a language ? '' and i say , `` well , this language
let 's be your own . ''
and then suddenly they can see what it would be like if they could do their own language .
so i want to talk to you a journey of today today , with a short journey , with the way to try to try to try to make them respond to you , which was actually lost .
now , there 's some of us that have been forget that i say , if i say , `` different ways , '' really different ways of what my story is mine .
take this child in the middle of the southern amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they 're doing the presence of the east from the board of apollo services .
this is a people which not invented between color blue and green , because that 's the end of the forest , that people are on , the eye is
you have a more intelligent language , and you called the most popular eye on the time called : you have to marry someone who talks another language .
all of this is the most recent past , the gap in these big houses , where the majority of six or seven languages are talking , is that you never hear somebody who is learning to be a language .
they 're just listening to speak and talk .
or , one of the most famous tribes i 've ever lived , the eye in the house , a amazing people , the first one in the year of four , the first time .
in the year , five and five , five brothers go to and made a great mistake .
they were flying sophisticated pictures from the air , and what we would like to do as was the sort of gesture of death , and they decided that these people from the rainforest has never seen some eye in their life .
they 're turning these photographs from the forest floor , and tried to see the face or the character , did n't find any of this to be the dna and killed the five brothers with the production .
but the interaction are not just outside of the outside of the world 's energy .
they 're doing each other .
now , the typical of the deaths are left with you .
we started back to the presence of eight generations of , and we found two cases of the natural death , and when we 're doing people who were a nuclear death about a map of it , they were become a world that was being so old ,
but at the same time , they had a clear fan of the forest that was amazing .
their civil civil rights could have the roofs of a animal from 40 feet of 40 , and to determine what the species of this was .
the early at the early end of years , i got a really amazing job when my professor was in harvard , whether i was interested in haiti and the secret societies of the strength , which was the foundation of the strength of the food and to make
to give this a sense of having a sense of giving a sense of this job , of course , something about the most remarkable faith that knowledge and dolphins is n't going to be a window of the black magic .
the opposite , it 's a complex light issue .
it 's interesting .
if i was asking you , the big economy of time , what would you say ?
th , islam , leo , is always the same thing , whatever .
a continent is always left left because the rare rate was that there are no religious faith in africa , and of course , there 's an idea of the very common religious thought that are the world 's
but what 's so interesting is that it is this space relationship between living and dead .
the living gave the script .
the indus script , in the great water , are to be in the large water , the answers to the rhythm of the dance to map the soul of the living room so that the game will be for a short player moment to god .
so , they 're like to say that the game likes to be , `` you know , you go to church and you like to god .
we dance in the jungle and become god 's god . ''
and because , they 're obsessed , you are going to reach off the spirit . how can you be being being able to make you get smarter ?
you see this amazing joke : you 're in a 3d store , and you see , there 's black coal without a amazing version of the ability of the ability of the mind that the body will affect the body , that this is when it 's going
now , from all the people i met , were the fbi 's memory , from the sierra mountain , the most mountain people 's mind , the most powerful .
so from the old eye civilization , the presence of the eye are diagnosed from working on columbia side of the way that they 're in a while of their people in the eye , which a german unit of a sudden smoking .
in a eye continent , these people were never been paid by the eye .
so , to a year today , you 're going to look at a plane 's a plane , the education education , but the education education is very extraordinary .
the young is going to the age of three and four years from their families and in a kind of black world , where the average of the glacier is on the age of 18 , and two times of each nine years -- two times from every nine
and during this whole time , you 're used to get into the values of your society , values that keep your mind your email and only , just your email , the most common -- we could say the green -- to keep the
at the end of this amazing neighborhood , you 're all of a sudden you get outside , in your life , in the age of 18 , you see a one , and in this moment of the first time of consciousness , when the sun starts to
it 's wonderful . you must protect it . ''
they call the older brothers , and say we 're the problem and the destruction of the world for the destruction of the world .
now , the level of that is very important .
and once we think about something and landscape we 're either thinking , and then we put the old president of the great prize of the great wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild
so , some other , some things are not a resource , you 're still going to get off your neighbor .
there 's no longer much place in the eye or the cold effect of bus , but yet , in time and a , of a powerful , a powerful game of the earth , not at the idea of her being being aware of , but to be
now , what does that mean ?
it means a little child out of the rubber hole that believe in the mind , the mountain is a trick , which is his or her own destiny , is a whole different person , and a little relationship to this kind of place that you can get
whether he 's a head of mind or a bunch of voice , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor is the metaphor that 's defined between the individual between nature .
i grew up in the forests of the golden park and i believed that these forests are there to be able to be able to be there .
this is what it made me to a different people , and i think that these forests think of the eye of the eye and the computer is the open to the eye , the most online , the most online thing , which they would be in their
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different features , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like , that plant .
it 's a picture i just touched last of the last april in the middle of the amazon .
this is the computer model , which has heard a lot of you , the powerful basic goods from the definition of the sea .
what 's so fascinating does n't make just that the trick of the eye is , but its ability to be in a whole page , and on one side , there is a series of the eye , the eye , and the eye on smoke , it
these whales have some very strong software that are the blood place , and they are very similar to them .
if you 've seen the eye , how you 've seen that stuff , these pieces , which you 've done from different ways to make it be more at the different ways .
so to actually fly this way , it 's about being able to be able to be able to be cut out of the end of a eye , and the highway on a sea of electricity .
it 's not going to be produced in reality , it 's going to be the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor richard richard , richard squared , who who were the chief eye in mexico in mexico , about this , about this , and i said that these are not as a vacuum device , because that 's where the effects you would
but the thing with the eye is they can not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able through one in the human being the name of it , they 're going to be able to be able to be
you can only put in terms of connection with some other chemicals that the dark ones are doing .
so what fascinating is that the game in the online industry are the same part of the way that is necessary to get the end , so ask itself .
how can these people from a generation of the small species of the plants are not able to find these two , or to plants that , if they do n't have the way that they do , a kind of `` the `` kind of thing , ''
we use this great chinese chinese , and try and mistakes what is going to be done as a research study .
but if you ask the indians , she 's like , `` the plant talks to us . ''
so , what does that mean ?
this is the tribe that has 17 different property of the sound that you all seem seen in a very large distance , that you see in the forest for our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how she 's treated your own fat , and you say , `` i thought you know some of the plants .
i mean , you know nothing , right ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that you take every one of the 17 things on the world 's disease and you sing to them sing a different bamboo ball .
now , this is no idea of you , no bridge in harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting than having a game .
now , the point is that , even those of us , are able to protect schools that are able to protect the hard way to the hard and the crowd , but in the people , they 're kind of the past , as the real world ,
so , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , 300 years or technical innovations , but as in the age of the biological and cultural diversity , the whole diversity of biological and cultural diversity are either being done in the earth , so that 's
all cultures have gone down to the dance with new skills .
and the problem is not the technology .
the game did n't have to be less at the age of being less at the meeting , when they did n't know the bow and the body of tasks when americans were being stopped americans , when they were a horse and they 're doing tasks .
not change and technology for some technology to the end of the eye . it 's power , the most basic face of atoms .
and where you 're going to be in the world , you 'll find that these cultures are not the world 's online world , and they 're dynamic , their existence , by the way , they 're in the front of the time , a trick ,
or if we go to the mountains of nigeria , i used to see much more work , and see the sound of the political bomb .
you know , the fourth of the genocide , which is based on human beings , but the trick , the destruction of the people , is not just civil , but in general , is n't a part of a eye .
and you can not understand the suffering when you 've experienced it .
i 've been looking at a young colleagues with a young colleagues , and i was looking for the eye for the eye and only when i was looking for the face of whom you hear -- fresh holy organic bodies that were turned in to the poor and
and my father was forced to this young lama as a foundation of the crime ,
that meant that he killed during the chinese cancer immediately .
his uncle 's uncle , with her sons , to the site that people brought up to rock .
his mother became in love for -- for the crime of the crime ,
he was in the age of two years of prison to hide under her the end , because they could n't live without it .
the sister who did n't create these eye , became a trick .
and then , one day she was left out on a hospital and it had to make them into seven years into seven years .
the suffering of suffering can be down , but the game 's mind is something that is something so far .
and at the end , we really are a choice in front of this , and if we do in a very eye 's world or a third world 's a crime world of the diversity of life ?
now , margaret game , who told the great budget said it was their most fear of fear , that while we 're going to move in the direction of a toy , we 're just just just the whole range of human imagination in the eye thinking ,
and it 's based on to think that our species may have been there for the last one .
the game revolution that got us to the agriculture , and we have to make ourselves a moment of the `` and the poetry of these images through these regions of marine houses and the hierarchy , and the courage created -- found 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world we know about is an 300 years old .
now , that little story , i do n't tell me that we all have the answers to the challenges that we are in the next way to be in the next way .
if we 're doing this tumor to the importance of people , the answer to call it with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we 're going to be able to take the possibility of what we are : people with a lot of consciousness that are aware of the importance that all people and people have to be able to be able to get into it ,
here 's a picture i took at the northern end of the eye when i went to the eye on the eye , and this man told me a wonderful story of his favorite piece of his favorite .
the holy government of government is not really good with the entropy of the body and the time the game 's years of the world 's world of our field , they were forced to go out to the outside of our own .
the grandfather ended up this old man .
the family who had fear in the way to be life , they took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the aliens have no fear in front of the cold , they used to benefit to their advantage .
the ones were originally out of fish that was thrown into the online paper .
the grandfather of man did not lie from the arctic night , or the eye .
he starts out to outside , his pants off his hand , and he goes in his hand . and when the crowd started to market market , he 's got it into the shape of a test .
he open down the side of the eye and when it was completely , and it was completely , he was in the end of the eye , he 's doing a dog .
he gives a demonstration and a report , the founder of the deep and clean a child , and they took a kid , and the u.s. rate of the eye on the dry eye .
and so you can do anything a little bit about anything .
and this is in many ways , a symbol of the resistance of the coast of coast and all of the world of all of the world 's early world in the world .
the holy government gave the west control in the u.k. , the complete control of the most area of the field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it 's our new country of land and it 's called `` you '' .
it 's just independent area . you all get the end together .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , a state , to have the germans to go on his search and achieve it .
and finally , i believe , is quite obvious , at least for those of us who are building to these kinds of goals of the earth , that they are not going to be away .
they 're the presence of somebody .
they 're kind of the parts of human imagination that are on the past times , and all of us , are the dreams of these kids like the dreams of our own children 's dreams .
now , what we 're an idea of doing national economic law , is that politicians never never do something .
we think that the eye is not a disaster problem , but we think that we can change the world , and so we 're probably probably the best institution for success , and our website , we get 35 million
complete countries all the time are our language language .
our career read the million of millions .
and we 're going to bring a series of travel into the eye where we take our audience to the audience to look at such an cultural wonder , that they would be in the very short , a little bit of wood , and hopefully , you know
thank you .
what i first do that quickly is to show the basic work , the basic work that we have is part of one of a high a camera , is to be in a year , in the same way . and it 's a environment that you can
we see many , many baby of digital baby members of digital , which you have an analogy and , you know , the kind of thing that you can do in any ways , to make a new way .
and it does n't matter how many information we look at how large these types are or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one is to be a very scan of the skin and it 's in a area of 300 eye .
it does n't matter because the only thing that 's the world 's point of a system like this is the number of oil in any point , and it has a very profound architecture .
this is a whole whole book , an example of the eye .
this is the sound of the house of engineering . every kind of an common being chapter .
to prove that it 's really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like that , to show that this is a real representation of the eye and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a while .
i would not recommend it .
this is a game case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image , the beginning of a rock image .
and that 's really really fun to you , and the good experience of a single set of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a way of media in a medium 's medium .
we also have something at the corner of this particular , special , special , the test .
we designed a false village with very high survey that is much higher than a normal one , and we 've added it in an fossil content .
if you want to see the dynamics of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical dancing , or it 's a little bit of them .
and this really changed these ideas that the ability in the areas is in the business ,
we hope that does n't mean a family service and other people who should n't be -- that should be necessary .
of course , the rate of this is a really clear obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really want to spend a lot of time here , except that we 're going to be different .
but this is all the streets in the united states .
so , at the top of nasa , nasa .
let 's now a different thing .
now this is even live on the web . you can look at it on the web .
this is a project with the name , '' a line , a lot of which really bring two different technologies .
one is the right , and the other is a very good research about the university of which in the university of the university , under the university of the university of steve is steve with the
and rick 's research in microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the web . it 's being replaced by the eye .
you can see this when we create these kinds of ability where we can train through images and make the experience of time ,
but the commitment to the pictures of the pictures is actually what we did .
the ones have taken these pictures together , so they 're going to have the real space , where these images that are made near the mental school industry , they 're doing here from civil school cells or the things , and the things
i do n't know if i have a time to show you other environments .
there are what we 're much more sophisticated .
i would love to show you a straight note of math , and this is from an early prototype of electronics that we 've been working at the first prototype in the summer to show that , what i think really , really , is obvious to the end
we had to do it for the lawyers 's disease . it 's worried about .
this is a ring of the rural evolutionary lady , which is a matter of using 10,000 , just a little piece of a computer , just lady in a way of men in a computer , and they 're going to go out images of men in a
so , this is all the things that we are in perspective in the different way to each other .
and we can try to try to try to try to move a simple way .
you know , i never believed that i 'm going to work at microsoft .
i 'm very grateful for the scale here .
i suspect you can see these are many different kinds of cameras , and everything is about , from the way , from the end of the eye , a pretty large number of them that have been taken by the environment .
and if you can , i will be able to find some of the strange strange .
many of you are visible in faces and so well .
there 's a series of dna sitting there , here you are .
this is actually a poster , of course , lady , who was named named a little bit of of robert lady .
we can actually move from a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environments , and now , it 's going to be collected about all of the flow of bacteria -- by the entire collective memory of it , the earth is like to create .
all these photographs are connected to each other , and there 's something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes from the entire earth .
looking at this as the power of narrative security is on virtual earth .
and this is something that complexity with the people who use people , and it 's going to use the user for the user and it 's going to be bigger .
their own photos are going to be the ones that you have a person 's going to get a different person .
if someone did the hard and they 've got all the holy ones , they 've been hoping they all are , then , my photo is going to take all the data with all of this data , and i can use them as a start to get
and of course , the oil of these are the huge rich of virtual virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that does n't just do it by with the face or innovation and so on , but that 's not going to be done by collective
thank you .
do you understand her ? do you make a matter that if you can make the software that you can see in a certain moment , all of the images that are used in the world in the world , are used to be connected to
yes . she does n't discover anything than it is .
if you want to get away down , you want to get back back between the images .
and you do this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the most powerful of the most powerful information that many of these pictures have .
so , like you do a eye of pictures , where you might ask your sentences and you might see the text of the website , a lot of information about that that image is .
but what if the picture is it to connect with all your pictures ?
then the range of the artistic is the most powerful , and the amount that makes it , really enormous . it 's a universal trick .
so , that 's really incredible . so , congratulations .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to tell you some things from my book , as i hope , in order with other things you 've already heard , and i 'm going to try to make a few connections if you do n't know
i want to start what i call `` the latest portrait '' ''
the strange thing that we have an x-ray kind of thing ?
the strange eye of the western people 's suffering societies .
an example of an x-ray works , if our goal is the goal of our citizens , this is all through the freedom of the human freedom .
the reason is , freedom in yourself is well , valuable , make sense of value for human human .
when people have freedom , each of us are about to do things that are actually independent and nobody has to do with us .
the way to maximize is , dangerous to be dangerous .
the more choices have the more of freedom , the more freedom , they have , and the more freedom they have , the more of the things they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our fossil community , that it would be no longer being able to question in real question .
and it 's also a deep deep in our life .
i 'm going to give you some examples of what to do modern progress .
this is my apartment . no big .
i just want to just say a little bit about the game .
there are 800 eye in my field , if you do n't do the 10 extra extra extra and 12 times that they could buy can create to make a great number of their own communities in the world , in which we did n't have the increase in
so that 's what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the local business to go -- `` you know , a trick , radio , radio , up , '' and in this one morning , in this business business there 's so many of the people 's license .
we can put millions of different different online systems of the brain workers , who are in this business that they 're being offered in this .
you need to admit that this is a big deal .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy , and you 'd put a phone every phone , you wanted as long as he came out of high bell bell .
you 're able to do it out , you have n't there .
a consequence of the evidence was that the phone was n't broken .
these days are over .
now , we now have almost an infinite choice of mobile phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are mobile phones 's future .
my favorite is in the middle -- the voice , the software and the use of oxygen .
and if you 've seen that until now not in your business , you can be sure you 'll be going to be soon .
and what it does is to walk in the business and to ask this question .
do you see the answer to this question ?
the answer is no . ''
it 's not possible to buy a mobile phone that does n't happen too much .
in other aspects of life , that are very important than what 's going to buy the same end of choice in the same direction of choice .
health -- it 's no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor 's telling you , we could do a job or we could do b .
a one has got to risks and risks .
b has become these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and she says , `` doctor , what do i do ? ''
the doctor says a set has these benefits and risks and b that has changed the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you were , doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i do n't have it . ''
the result is -- we call it it `` patient . '' and that sounds like a good thing , but in the reality , the burden of the main design of the people , for example , is at someone 's , at the best community , and
there 's an enormous marketing for social drugs for people like them and me , that , when you think about it , you do n't make sense , because we do n't buy them .
why are you going to get around us if we 're not able to buy ?
and the answer is , they 're going to put from us to the doctor 's office and ask a change for the office morning .
so something that works like our identity is now a question of choice like this slide .
we 're not making identity , and we invent them .
and we 're really trained a lot more as we want to .
so that means that every day when you 're going to go on the morning , you have to decide what 's kind of person to be .
and in terms of marriage and family , there was a time that is when you had one had everybody , and that they could go as fast as they could , and then quickly kids were able to get it .
the only choice was `` who '' not when , and not what they were doing .
and today , it 's all too too .
i 'm also also also also a wonderful intelligent students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that 's not because they 're not smart , and not because they 're not quite cool .
it 's because it 's busy things , you 're asking yourself , `` should i have married ? i should i marry it ?
should i be able to ? i should n't have children , or did i want to come in career ? ''
these are all questions .
and you will ask these questions , whether that means all the stuff that i do is not that i 'm wearing them , and not good at the front of my story .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to do questions .
work -- we 're as well as being a little bit , and technology that can allow us to work every minute from every day from every day from every place from every place to every place on every place -- to the game of the hotel .
and by the way , there 's a corner i 'm going to tell you about that , where this is working with you .
i 'm not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice , we have to make decisions in terms of work and again , and again , if we should work or work or work .
we can play our kids to play by the best , and we have our phone phone , and our strength of our suffering , and our laptop are probably on our pockets .
and even if they all go down , every minute in which we ask our child to the age of a collective single single single size of a collective single single single single single single single single size of questions , we 're going to be , `` should
should i be on this email ? should i write that letter letter ? ''
and even when the answer to the question , `` no , '' there is probably your experience of the people who are very different than it was a different thing than it was .
everywhere we look at , big things and little things , material things and purpose is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived , this was like .
so i want to say , there was some choices , but not all that was a matter of choice .
and the world in which we 're going to see , is this way .
and the question is , are good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what it is good about , so i 'm going to be bad about what is bad .
all of these experiences have two effects , two negative effects in humans .
it 's an effect , a way that it 's very much more free .
so with so many options , you can choose , people will very hard to decide how to do .
i 'm going to give you another example of examples , a study about investment in a massive muslim .
a woman who had access to me with the eye of the eye , the giant people of the most and 2000 different different jobs .
and what she was offered to be a 10 when i was offered to be able to get the peace of the tsunami , the one by the tsunami , was the one by two percent .
they provide 50 to the 50 at -- 10 percent less employees take it in the way they 're only going to offer five . why ?
because it 's 50 to the need to have a lot of people to decide is to decide what to choose to do that , and you 're put it on tomorrow .
and then they go up and then never comes and tomorrow , of course .
now , you know , that 's not just a mean , people have to be to eat , if they go to the fear , because they do n't have enough money to get it , and the decisions that they mean so hard is that they miss
by the way , by not for 10 u.s. , a year per year , a year at the field of the field of being happy to learn to her coffee .
in fact , in the world , it 's a consequence of to many choices .
and i think it makes the world looks like this .
you really want to make a decision , if it 's all the pants , right ?
they do n't want to choose the wrong investment behind the fake or even the wrong spot .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we come to the school and come to the ground , and a decision , we end up with a less smart to the side of the way that we 've had the ability to decide
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is founded through the big choice of different eye in the time when you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and what is there for perfect ? it 's just a different decision that you would have to have a decision , and
the more possibilities there are the easy thing to have actually military military has been the choice for the choice they meet .
second , what economists call themselves .
dan , he has made a big point of this morning by telling how much the way that we would , is to see what we compare .
well , if there 's a very many alternative to remember , it 's just unique properties to imagine from some alternative things that you 're laughing , that makes you win with the alternative you 're playing .
here 's an example . for you , that are no new yorker , i really sorry .
but here 's what you should think of .
here 's some on the skin islands .
very expensive real , real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real .
beautiful beach . they have everything that all the self .
what could be better ? `` it 's this man , '' `` it 's august .
everybody in my eye is gone away .
i could just make it just an house . ''
and he was spending two weeks the thought he had sent the possibility day day a great lot of , day .
so the great happiness is that we get our own choices , even if that 's fantastic , we have fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have the more , the more , are more active properties in the eye .
here 's another example .
now , this cartoon is a couple of point .
he makes a statement on the right , and maybe to do things about things .
but the more important point he is : always , who you decide are , you decide , you want to decide to do some of them 's , you ca n't choose things .
and these other things like many , many are a lot of active properties , and it 's going to be what they 're going to do less .
third , is the expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to learn my home .
i 'm wearing the morning , almost to speak all the time .
and there was a time where it was just in the kind of form of a kind of time , and they bought them , and they 're bad , they were incredibly lucky and if they were going to be the long enough , they 're often able
so , in order to buy new school after a lot of years of the time of the old time , and i said , `` i would have been a couple more an old job , here 's my size . ''
and the third said , `` want to be biological , so you want , '' you 're easily right up or so big ?
do you want to write a buttons or anything ?
do you want to be in the morning ?
if you want to be in the bottom far , you want to look at , blah blah -- and so on , he said he told me .
my business 's mind was down , and after i am in a remarkable , i said , `` i love to love the way that was the only way that was the only way that was the only way . ''
he had no idea what was , so , i spent one hour with all the original head up , and the truth is -- and i say the truth -- with the value of the value in the street , i 've ever had .
i had better , and all these things had to have it to me .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote , i wrote a whole book to try and explain myself .
the reason i felt bad is with all these tools with all these kinds of ways of what 's going to be a good couple of the road , up .
i had a very low expectations . i had no more expectations when it was that they were in a kind of kind of .
when they came into 100 ways they would have had perfect .
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so what i did was what i was getting for what i needed to do , and what i had was , was moved to what i was getting out of the best time to what i was expected to .
people in people in the life of people increases more and the expectations that people have as good possibilities to be good .
and this leads to be less nice with the results , even when the results are good .
nobody in the world of the marketing knows what this knows . because if you would , you would , you know , all this is all that comes here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that this was all better was better than everything was worse than everything else was possible for people to make a safe surprise .
today , in the world of that , we live -- we 're rich , we 're going to be rich , we 're going to be able to see citizens as an expectation -- the best for the hope that we can hope is so good , as
you 're never going to be surprised . because your expectations , my expectations , are just designed .
the secret to the sense of the main -- that 's what they all came -- the secret is low expectations .
i want to say -- a little bit of time i 'm married -- i 'm married with her one , and she 's really wonderful .
i could n't do better . i did n't fall to fall .
but in general , it 's not a bad thing .
well , there 's a consequence of the effect of the head of a bad computer class , if it 's just a way to buy , is that if you 're concerned about , and you 're wondering why , who 's responsible . the world is responsible
if hundreds of different types of different types are available , and they 're buying the leaves , and they ask why who 's in charge ?
it 's also clear that the answer is the question of the question is , they 're .
they would have better to do it .
so , with 100 different types of asia in the spring , there 's no excuse for mistakes .
so , when people meet decisions , and if the results of decisions are well , they feel like they 're going to fall down themselves .
clinical depression in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a link -- not the only one , but a relationship to this led to the depression , and also , is that people are beginning to experience the nobel deal because their standards are so high , and then , if you feel these experiences ,
and so that 's the trick we go better , we 're getting , we know , we 're bad , and we feel it .
so let me remember you .
this is an commercial image that we all think of right , completely wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no question that something often is better than not , but it does n't follow that more has a more better thing than something .
there 's a magic amount of a lot . i do n't know what it is .
i 'm pretty sure that we have had a long time to have this kind of thing to do with the need to our public care .
now , as an answer -- i 'm almost finished -- as a change question , which is what all of the things that these are to allow you to be able to be in the late societies , is material is
there are many places in the world , and we 've heard about many of them whose problem is not too much .
you see , you have it , you have them to do it .
so the things i 'm talking about is a very fundamental problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and smell , steve brown tells you about how this expensive expensive thing and hard to do not help . it 's a waste of money .
what i tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy to help them .
you actually get a lot .
they worry that we are bad .
when something of the people in the society are allowed to make these decisions that people would have to have , and they would not only have to have to have to say , life of people would be better , but our dignity would be better .
economists call this question a trick .
so , to make it , all of the way better , is n't just the poor -- because all of these big choices are being a phosphorus .
finally , they 're reading , and , a famous person , says , `` ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know nothing possible in that table . ''
now , even more than it 's going to make a impact , an impact view of the world -- and that is the way i read about .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view of the fish , the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you do it in the power , so that everything can get , you do n't have freedom , you have the middle of them .
if you do it in the power , so it 's possible , you lose happiness .
it gets the land and the happiness .
everybody needs a trick .
and it 's almost with perfect security -- perhaps too well for fish , definitely for us .
but the game is a recipe to be called with computer , and i guess it 's a disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i 've talked about some of these projects earlier about the human genome and what could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start to start with a new point : we have a lot of food , and now we 're trying to try to get the whole code in the digital code , to create new life and build new life .
we 've always tried to ask that way .
what is life ? it 's something that i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and it on different levels .
we 've tried different kinds of trying to make it all up to the rise components .
we almost have about 20 years . when we were able to have a game that we 've got the game , the change of the social world of biology is the computer .
now we 're trying to ask whether we can be able to be able to control , or whether we can make new life out of this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the fact that the smallest genome of a species can be able to be able to protect itself in the lab , and we 've tried to get a smaller bit smaller genome .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes by the 500 or so that these are .
but if we look at these remarkable map that 's very simple , to our own trust , trust me , but if we all know all these genes , we 're very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell
so we decided that it 's the only way to go to the fact that this field is actually trying to actually allow us to have the individual components and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to question with the question , we can just draw a organic picture ?
can it be the chemistry of doing these chemistry that really have to do these kinds of big molecules that never did before ?
and , if we can , we can start the wind ?
a cancer is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps at our county was exponential .
our ability to write genetic code , very slowly , are made to be made , and our point would be put on a exponential curve .
we started now 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years of all with a stick to get the first experiments before we did the first experiments .
it turns out it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are small pieces of dna , 30 or 50 letters long long , it 's a trick , so you 've got a piece of power , it 's much more mistake .
so we had to develop a new way to develop that we could get these little pieces together and that we could see mistakes .
this was our first attempt that was starting with the digital information , the genome of the genome , the genome in the u.s. ,
it 's a little bit of the bacteria .
we 've made small pieces , made a interview , and we had a dna of the world 's time , and we had a local molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of chemical and put bacteria into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made these places
the common particles then were then accepted the cells from the cells and they came back back and kill hot silence .
recently , i 've talked to the eye , and they told you that this model is exactly the same thing .
they laugh more than she does this .
so , we think that this is a situation in the software that actually can build up their hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole job building up , and it was more than a game of the world 's code , and so we thought , we were , we 're building it into the size of the virus
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information , that digital information has to be really sustainable .
when we went out the genome for a mistake , the world was in a mistake per mistake per 10,000 .
we found about 30 mistakes . if we had a original sequence , there would never have been able to make it go out there .
and part of design is , you can make it create 50 letters long , and look at the other skills to build smaller to build these conservation .
we 've built a unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in the way .
think about it : we have a trick code : a , c , g and t .
so , this letter -- this letter , this letter are about about 20 acids ; and here is a single amount of a number of the waste .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we only looked at first by those , we 've seen in the first time .
some people were trying to be trying to be poetry .
we have so made the pieces of what we just could use it with , and there is a carbon thing that is that it 's that it 's ugly , and there 's the way we get it back .
and we started to create pieces , we 're starting to see the five times the five , five to the ] eye letters , they have to make these things to make these back to the way to make it go up to the end .
in any step , we 've been able to create these pieces of being able to make it , because we tried to create a very profound process , to create a very profound process , what they 're going to see in an minute .
we 've tried to get to the point of the child 's child system .
so that looks like a game in the eye .
if we 're going to look at large , it 's about 100,000 and about 10,000 , and this is not just in the street 's name , and it 's all the opportunities of modern biology . and so we were going to
we knew we knew about a mechanism that 's called the biology , the biology , using the biology to fix dna that could be able to have .
here 's an example of that . there is a organism called the three million samples of radiation being in radiation .
you see the upper field in the upper field that his brain is just simply fall apart .
12 to 24 hours later , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , was as opposed to it .
we can do thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally , they can even live in a vacuum .
and i 'm absolutely sure life can exist in space and move to look for the search of conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are lots of there .
here 's a trick from the molecule that we 've been made by using these processes -- in fact , we use a game with the real design of the pieces we have , and yeast away from the space , they then put away together .
this is not an normal device .
it 's a big molecule that we can actually see it with the eye .
this is out of images of a while a least seconds .
that 's the time we 've been finished recently .
so these are the most popular letter in the study of language , and it 's the biggest molecule with the structure that has been created by human structure .
it has a close show from over 300 million .
if we spent it from a while 10 and not spent it , it would be close to close to close to the time to give them that genetic code .
now how do we start with a bomb ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it 's very simple , it 's much more complicated with bacteria .
it 's also easier when you 're in the eye as we are , you just take your sleep out and there 's the same thing you all heard about transportation .
so the way that the field is to put the cell in the cell , but we 've shown it in recently that you can make a full set of a nuclear map of a nuclear cell system and it can turn that out of it .
we 're building the field of one of the time in technology , which is these two of the big one of the way that people and lies , and we gave them a while of the way we could make this chemical , and we put it on
the new field went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there 's the end , but we 've got to bring the process .
that 's the presence of evolution here .
we 've taken all kinds of species here , or a third chemical of the eye , each time the thousands of things are in just a species to have a species .
so people who are thinking about this gene that 's changed to one time , they 're all sent a lot of biology .
there are a lot of sand called the ones that are actually going to be dna roots .
the field in the cell has been not ; the oil ones we have in charge of us .
it was getting out in the cell and realized the other part of the eye in the front of the eye , and so we had a cell at the end only a new field .
it 's blue because it had the genes that we put in .
and after a short time , it had lost the characteristics of the species , and it 's completely based on the new software based on the new software that we have given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the religious community -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we 've done .
it may sound like you sound on sound , but we can , by the way , by the way we reach the presence , we can change things pretty dramatic .
now i 'm happy to him that this is not the eye -- this is based on the age of religious evolution evolution .
and i 'm happy to suggest that we might make a new form of the ocean explosion based on the digital online system based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious to what we need .
and we 're at a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a way from a thousand billion people in the next 40 years
to ask it to my connection , i was born in the year .
today three people on this planet has shown for each of those of us who exist in the year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with a break and clean water , medicine , on the other hand , on the other hand , for two billion people .
it 's going to be a challenge for nine to offer .
we need over five billion tons of coal , billions of plastic oil -- that 's a hundred million dinosaurs on a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's all co2 co2 on this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries of discovery from the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the eye of the future .
the game had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of which came back .
we 're going to get this line of the biological line in the first line of biological reality and to those our idea .
we have technologies today to be able to do this , to do what we call ourselves fight .
now , we have the ability to create the possibility of the amount of the millions of hydrogen devices at the day .
if you do , these 20 million million genes are creating or to make this processes to create a way of drugs or drugs , we can change a very little team of creative change than the last 20 years .
and it 's just the presence of selection . we can do it in the same way , production of chemicals or go to the eye and so on .
that 's a shot from a collective eye with that we work with , actually to create new species in the computer .
you know , we do n't necessarily know what it will look like . we know exactly what the most genetic code will look .
now , we focus on this fourth generation .
they 've seen a square to square , just seen what 's just a bad experiment .
we have superstar growth and third generation that 's relatively soon higher to be able to make the much higher ones , at least different kinds of eye .
but , as we think , the only way to think of biology is a big impact without the cost of food food , or the food unit of their availability is when we see co2 as a more more material , and therefore we 're working on cells
and we think we 're going to be the first with the fourth generation , and in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery , the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism we described in our own .
he lives in the floor , it lives about miles deep , and it 's almost possible .
it 's carbon co2 dioxide in over the use of hydrogen use than the use of hydrogen than the use of hydrogen .
we 're looking at whether we can use tens of carbon co2 that simply could be brought out to the place , they 're going to be able to fix co2 in the way to make that process .
within a short time , we could be able to be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- as well as the oil industry , the whole century industry , right , right . right , if you could do that at ted , where otherwise , is the individual of energy .
but the same thing we 're working on is the same way to use the same way of getting using the development of the atmosphere .
they saw this year with this guy , we 're always on a year at the back , and they have a dollar .
i think that 's what changed is that by the way you make some online form .
that 's what the future could look like changes , can be the presence of the eye , are actually moving with synthetic bacteria , so and may turn the food itself .
we 're very early years of all of it . our goal is to be a chance to survive to do it . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave a classroom for the big bang .
and i 'm listening back to come to you to explain how the machine works .
so now it 's far as far . and for all those people were n't there , the big scientific experiment is the most scientific scientific experiment that was the medical market -- 27 miles in the diameter .
his job is to create the conditions which less than a billion second to the universe -- and the one that goes to 600 million per second .
it 's just the violent lanes .
this is the machine underneath the machine .
we can take pictures to be in terms of leadership .
i 'm on this work . it 's called the economic detector -- 13 feet in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of the suffering that we see you 'll see your hands up .
on 10 , last year , the machine was going to be the machine for the first time .
and this picture was taken by the horse of its stomach .
it took the huge ones in the control control .
it 's a picture of the first eye that took all the way around the lhc , then it 's a part of the lhc to make a rain rain from particles on the open business forest .
when we saw this picture in other words , when we saw this picture on 10 . the machine is working what a big hit colony .
i do n't know if this was a biggest eye , or as someone else 's left the google , and then found the path .
it means that we took a cultural impact for science .
about one week later , there was a problem with the machine that had this place with this machine -- these golden communities here .
these are the nest effect by the end of the time when the machine is going to go on .
now , the engineers of you will look at you and say , `` no , no one of those things do n't do . these are little jobs . ''
you can afford that because if you 're very , very few , you 'll get to see it .
so in example , from a degree of degrees , and it 's more than the space between stars , can these cost of the tension .
in one of the connections between your eye in the lhc , there 's a trick .
and so they 're moving out the local ones , and they 're actually very close to suddenly look at the private way of the way .
so this was the result .
now , this is all even more as you think that the average rate of 20 tons of miles and around about about 30 inches of community .
so we 're looking at about 50 of the notes about the government .
and it 's what we had to do is we did .
so we 're doing them , you 're doing it .
they 're all back to their way back .
over the end of the , the lhc is going to be the lhc again .
we 're going to get it to the other trade trade , and we can get to collect the first data in june or july , and then we 're trying to figure out what the building cancer has the building building building .
well , of course , in a kind of public terms , the debate for the debate to about science and the eye on these borders . it 's easy to fail .
i think the fact that it is so hard to the fact that we 're going to be able to go beyond our borders , it 's a value of things like the big value .
i 'm going to leave my latest words to the english scientist , before , who , how i suspect when he was the most dangerous experiments of his eye , a student , which is , `` is that there 's no security ideas that our ecosystems are
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
so i 'm going to write books is my job , but it 's obviously more than that .
it 's my big , i think i could love a love and the deep thing .
and i did n't expect that that is going to change .
however , in fact , it 's a little bit more comfortable in my life and my career , i made it to think of to think of this work completely at the work .
this is an amazing event i wrote recently a book , and a cup called the eye , egypt , the eye , the eye , and that , i think , in the , things decided that you are of the last books , i think differently was
the result is that i should not be able to come in where i 'm going to be treated as i 'd be the world 's mind .
seriously , the beginning of the world .
for example , she gets very worried about , say , `` fear do you not , you know , you 're going to be this success here ?
do n't fear fear that they are their entire life of gdp and never create a book , the common in the world , never again ?
okay , that 's really going to make that kind of get .
but it would be worse if i was n't remember that i was n't saying about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time , that i was to be the idea of the same kind of eye , the first way that i 'd
people said , `` did n't be afraid , never succeeded ?
do n't fear you believe you were the opposite of the world a box in a box ?
did you have to fear that you get to your life and have never come to something and that you 're going to die on a while with dreams -- your mouth filled up with your mouth on the expense of the customer of the
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of this questions is , `` do n't it ''
yeah , i 've got scared of all these things .
and i always had to do .
and i have a lot more things about that , i think , that no one would look .
like the drug -- and other things are doing things .
but , if it comes to writing , i have been thinking i have been thinking about it , and i ask myself , why ?
is that the consumer box ?
is it sense that he should be expected to fear the fear of to do the work that he feels for jobs ?
and what about the creative new structures to do more minds about the relationship of what it 's more more than more than that -- in a way , what does n't do like other jobs ?
my father , for example , was a great , and i can not remember myself in his 40 years , which he was asked , were he afraid he had become afraid .
and you 're with your saying , john -- how do you go with this ?
it just did n't know what she knows ?
but to be fair -- the group of the cybercriminals have not received for the most of the eye for the most common people .
but we seem to have this kind of call , but not just the author , but the creative thing that seemed to have this call is to be being hurt .
all you have to do is that the absolute economic people who are in really really great internet come out of the 20th century , the young century of the hand , they would often be died of their hand .
and even the ones that do n't actually think about wikipedia , seemed by the ability to be in the really slow .
but , in a minute , before you were in his final interview , you 're going to get a little bit of further up a little bit of further on my books .
an extraordinary statement you can do about your world 's way .
but we do n't even know if we hear something like that , because we know that kind of thing a long time for such a long time , and somehow we have so forth and more likely to get that creativity and suffering , and that 's where
the question that i want to put with each of here is is , is this idea for you to be in order ?
do you feel about it ? because just with only a plane , i feel not a little bit of the subject .
i find it to be a secret of the time .
and i think it is dangerous . and i do n't want to watch it to the next century .
i find it better when we live our major creative experiences .
and i realized , i believe -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark way of the colony 's way -- especially in the fact that i 'm really really interested in my career .
that means -- look at a young , i 'm only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 eye on me .
and it 's very likely to do what i 'm going to write about now from the world as the work being made after the end of my last book , right ?
i tell it it up , because we 're all friends , and they 're very likely to be my greatest success .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought of thinking that someone can take to go up the day nine o'clock morning , and i do n't want that .
i 'd rather keep the thing i 'd like to do , i 'd love to love this work i love .
so , the question is : how ?
after a while , the trick seems to be able to do writing , a kind of a very eye weather .
and somehow i have to find a way to write a certain distance , and i 'm going to do that between my very , very natural ted of what the response will be to be the writing .
while i was looking for models for models to do this , i also looked for that past , and i 've tried to find other societies to see if you might help , how might you help creative risk , with the emotional risks that are connected to
this is looking back to me in the old institute and the old valley .
please follow me because the circle will be close again .
but in the old union , and rome do n't have believed creativity 's being doing , okay ?
they thought creativity was a kind of honor of being made from a sudden of conflict , low source to the people -- they come from .
the greeks called called the universal driver 's creativity .
from the design system , it 's known to be a trick that would have a trick that he started around to continue to get away from further .
the former school had the same idea , and they called this kind of a creative mind .
this is amazing . the gods did n't really think a genius , a genius , a particularly french individual .
they thought that a genius was a genius of art in the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls -- something like the game , the ones , the ones , the game and artists would make invisible voice and the result of work .
this is brilliant -- there 's a distance i talked about -- the psychological code that you protect your consequences to the consequences .
and everybody knew it worked like right ?
the artist artist , in front of the eye , was in a certain things of medicine , like , for example , there 's too much , right ?
when your work has been a great number , you do n't look at anything to the square of you , everybody knew you had the same way you had a little bit of the same way that you had to go .
if your work is still not , you 're not completely much mistakes , right ?
everybody knew their genius , your genius .
so the people in the west were really long time in creativity .
and then the way and everything changed and all of these big things -- and this big idea : let 's put the human public 's human individual thinking , and the gods and the world 's greatest and market , and there 's no room for the more
it 's the beginning of the economic age , and people started to start that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time , in the history , people hear that or they call these artists a genius -- instead he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a visual person to allow you to think he thinks , or she is like the secret thing , like the disney and the essence and the source and the source and the source and the source , of all , is a little
it 's like someone to make the sun .
the software system and it creates all the mobile expectations , and it creates all of this conservation expectations on success .
i think that this is the software , we 've been in our artists , which is the last 500 years .
and , if that 's true , -- and i think it 's true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to an extent of an hour about people and their mystery of the creative box .
maybe you wo n't .
maybe we can not cut this down from 500 years of 500 years , just in an eye 's point .
and there are certainly people in this audience who really had a very scientific scientific song , which is the idea of -- basically -- did we go and apply people and make it out on their projects .
i 'm not going to take all of them on that journey .
but the question that i want to do is : why not ?
why not think ?
because it makes you a lot of sense like everything i 've heard about , if it went to explain the most crazy , crazy to explain the creative process .
a process that goes -- like anyone know that it has tried to do something -- in other words , everyone here -- not always any other -- not any other
in fact , he can actually feel pretty much a laugh .
i had been a lot of time recently as i 've met the extraordinary american museum in the most american museum of the american york , stone , who are now about 90 , which was the most of the most years , but it was all her own
she said it would be like a while of air .
that was about the country to her .
she felt when it was , because it would bring earth under their feet .
they knew that she could only do that in a moment that was -- and that was -- in her words -- you know , like the game .
she goes as she was taken at the house while she was taken away from this poem , it was just about that they would go to a piece of paper and had to get it to them if they could go to the presence of them , driving
it was n't very fast to other phones , not it 's gone , and ran and down , but she did n't wake the poem , and they gave it . she would go on land of land and -- like she said -- go to another
and then there were this moments , and that part of this , i never get to forget -- she said there was moments that there were moments where they 're almost talking about it .
so , it 's running up to the house and looking for paper , and she 's looking at it , and she 's going to be a pencil in a very pen and then she 's going to get it -- she was like , she was ,
she was wearing the poem at its laptop and she moved back into their body , and she took it to the sheet of paper .
and then , the poem came down , and we had a little bit , and it 's a paper , but in -- for the last word i first .
when i heard that , `` it was an incredibly scary -- that 's exactly what my creative process is doing . ''
and that 's not like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel !
i 'm a trick . to work , i have to get every day , i 'm going to go to the same time , and i realized , both my day , really , really , really uncomfortable .
but even i have a thing sometimes that thing in my mind .
and i guess many of you have done that .
and i had , or ideas , or ideas , who have a source of a source of me who do n't really know what i do n't know .
what is this a thing ?
and how do we begin to lose ourselves into the relationship without trying to lose our minds , but even in mental health ?
for me , i 'm the best living example of how you create this can create , the square , and i could actually get it a few years ago in a magazine .
and we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time in your life was tom 's disease , modern artist , who was trying to figure out these 's creative creative , which used to be able to control the
but then he became older and writing . he told me that he went to a day on los angeles . and there 's something that changed for him .
he was going to take a little speed of speed when he was a little entrepreneur of a consumer tool that 's often a little bit of time for him to get away , and he wants to stop it . she 's saying it 's a lot of
he does n't have a piece of paper , he does n't have a pen ; he 's got a pen .
so he starts starting to take this old tour of him , like , `` i 'm going to lose this thing , and i 'm going to be able to be able to be close by this song .
i 'm not good enough , i do n't know .
but instead of panic , he just stopped .
he ended up all the place and he ended up something completely new .
he just looked at just the sky in heaven and said , `` okay , you do n't you see that i 'm going to go to car that ? ''
do i go to you ? i 'm going to go to a song in a song ?
if you want to have , you come to a while of the time , when i can do around you .
if you do n't , somebody else today .
go and `` dry '' and ...
his whole line has changed .
not the work . it 's often as dark as you 've ever done and the fact .
but the process and the hope that it was , was he was looking at was the genius he took the genius where he was n't going to be in trouble and he was so forth in his face , and he realized that there had no
it could be a cheap , weird , weird , weird , weird , weird , kind of work , a conversation between tom and the car , health , health thing that was n't at tom .
when i heard this story , i changed a bit of the way that i was working , and i had been saved .
this idea , i call me the front in the front of the eye , california , the end , i fell in one of the field that we all of looking at in all the field in which we were in something , if we were working on
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just make the project .
but then i immediately talked about how tom was talking about the free and talked about it , and i tried it .
so i took my looking at the chest `` i spoke my grandfather going into an empty corner of the room .
i was talking to speak : `` stop , '' and i both know both of that , if this book is n't enough , it 's not enough that it 's not completely completely going to be right ?
because you see , i have everything i have , and i do n't have any more than that .
so if you want to have better , you 've got to show up here and share a share of the things that i do .
okay . but if you do n't do that , you know what the devil is doing with you .
i 'm going to write still , because that 's my job .
and i want to give up , please , that i 'm going to be today for the jobs here .
because ... , you know , it 's like action . in all centuries , there 's been the way in the '50s , people get the people with the russian crime and music , and they get it to the five brothers , until the ones .
these are always amazing , because the dancer were in all the time , they were fantastic .
but again , again , it 's a rare , very rare , happened something special . one of the tumors was actually accepted .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all saw in your life already seen such a bridge sign .
it was as if the food 's about a kind of paper industry had been used , and he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 feet before . but all i got together .
and suddenly , he did no longer get human .
he was convicted of the inside of the day , and it was in the bottom station , and everything turned out through a dry fire .
as far as the back of this happened , people knew what was . they called it it in his name .
they put their hands together , they were singing , `` okay , galvao , galvao , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical bubbles are made that way in the way that they brought that practice . the one thing that changed the day of the most of the eye , the world 's moving to the most centuries of the eye , the end , the way that you
when a small and an infection in spain , a bit of marketing , is something called magic , the skills , `` oops , '' it is , `` at the end , '' it is , a kind of a computer look at god .
and that 's great because we need that .
but , who is part of the next morning when the food 's home , and the dancer itself , and realize that there 's 11 o'clock at 11 o'clock -- and he does n't have longer a trick of god .
he 's just a commercial facility with microsoft 's knee knee , and maybe he never will have moved to those three times .
and perhaps someone will be any of god to call it , if it comes to , what do you want to start with his life ?
that 's hard .
that 's one of the eye of a creative life .
but maybe it does n't have to be as much as if you have a way of starting , that most basic ideas of your performance of their work of them .
if you may only believe that they 're a philosophy -- from the local source of their life that 's going to be in someone else , if you 've done done with it .
if we start thinking about that , everything changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with security months , while i was working on the book , that soon , that 's when we wanted to be dangerous , it was just a lot of time to talk about my voices .
what i 'm going to say to myself is , if i 'm going to go on it , i do n't have a fear .
it 's not uncommon .
just do your job .
it 's always working for your perception , whatever it 's said , `` you always . ''
if you 're a little job , dance .
if the visual is so far as a universal , genius , that you 've asked you , you 're not going to be able to show you a moment a moment of wonder from your effort , then you 're going !
and if you do n't , it 's your dance .
you 're in the order .
i believe , and i feel like we should teach this .
so , for example , despite all of this , just for just the only human love and the eye being able to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
marcus !
last year , i 've shown these two slides of research to prove the journey that had been in high three million years , the size of the lower states , to be 40 percent in the lower
but this is no very strong enough to the level of the particular problem , because it 's not the cost of ice .
so , the standard sense is going to be able to think of the most basic heart of global global health .
it grows in the winter and mass fishing in the summer ,
the next slide i 'm showing is an eye of what happened in the last 25 years .
the eye is with red .
as you can see , on the dark stage , this is the male ice in the winter ; and it 's the mass of the summer .
what you can find out is that five years of a blood or older , is almost a blood that looks like the body in the body .
in 25 years , it will be gone by here .
this is a problem because the warming warming warming the colony that are in order to go around the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of work to be carbon , which is to be able to do by methane , by the cure .
so compared to the whole range of time , and you can see that that amount of time could double when we cross this critical time .
now , in some of the most a few , we have now , in the few , nuclear america in alaska 's all of themselves , from water .
professor 's eyes in alaska is a different group of the last in the university of the last century on the last night .
wow !
you 're fine . the question is , how do you get it .
and one reason is that this huge heat is actually known by the north .
this is a new trick .
but the business industry are much bigger than ever before .
this is the presence of river .
if you want to know what sea sea goes up by going on here , it 's going to the sea .
these rivers take a lot of equipment .
on the other end of the planet , the mountain sector , the largest ice ice on the planet .
last month from researchers , the entire continent now , there 's a negative trick .
and the ones that showed up and showed you about a few eye is particularly very much in the ice .
this is 20 feet of light theater , as an greenland .
in the context , the food is down , you see new percent of the top , which were the food in front of a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people that get half of their eye is in the world .
in the 1930s , this glacier is the eye for this city .
the oil have a result of mind .
but if you 're doing , most of the water is doing .
in california , a 40 percent of the eye population of the eye was seen .
that 's the game .
and the predictions that they 've read , are serious .
and these are the eye in all the world to a dramatic increase on the world .
and the industry everywhere all over the world are in a really business , and it never went to it , and did never stand down .
many times as many years as we can do it is 75 30 years .
this is a totally game game .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we 've produced 70 million tons of carbon co2 hours -- 25 million tons of tons of tons of the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific pacific , right , from the american continent , the island of the american island of the city and the effort to the indian eye , where there 's a power increase in the ocean in the ocean .
the biggest individual is global warming , next to the next percent , is the equivalent of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most hidden problem .
the united states is one of the two ones in china together with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot of other online online
but we begin to see a change .
here are the fact that we have been born in the last few years , with some green alternative market , that were expected .
but there 's happened there 's a political experience in our country .
and the ones and the end has spent a food one last one , to make clean coal , which is already a contradiction in it .
this picture , you know , you can tell something .
and the day of day were gone around home in england , a billion tons of eye in me .
you saw it right in the news .
this is our entire country of the eye of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the main signs of the dolphins and i was this one of this .
so the trick is a trick , happy americans .
it 's in the and lots of and lots of and lots of time in america , and it 's going to grow our economy .
so , the trick is going to be a day in every day .
he 's got to be done and fire , and the workers remain in both of the bread and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful ones is the head of high atoms .
let me really , you know , al gore , who are , harry brilliant , you do n't know what you 're talking about .
so the production of the epidemic for electric two open open open in life .
this is one , part of her .
and at the end of the way , we see the world as a serious danger of our business .
so we have a lot of the eye to spend a more more a more a more a commitment to the way to get the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not static .
we believe it 's clean -- and still do good ?
so , do n't worry about the climate .
let 's leave it .
so coal coal , you 've heard a lot of it .
so , let me give you a tour of this modern , sustainable force with this .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it is the sound of the pantheon .
and yet , the most apple thing by the coal is one of the main things for the global warming , the remarkable damage you see here , everything changes everything .
look at it , right , that 's the problem for the fish is today .
finally , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge , and our challenge of the national challenge .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all together is our face of the eye of the eye and germany , and we all have an eye company .
but now , there 's a kind of a kind of new solution to just make ourselves that we can .
now , it 's going to take in america with 100 percent electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to make america back to work , make us make the global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough , is to solve our problems .
take america , you know . find more .
this is the last .
it 's about america 's face .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence from old , electrical causes , to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment systems to create good jobs .
basic america , it 's time to accept reality .
there 's an old african saying , `` if you want to be fast , you 'll go on .
if you want to come far , go together . ''
we have to come far , and quickly , very quickly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you at the time of your childhood when they were playing with it .
as you realized how to go and get your hands and get the ones , and move the eye , and you move , and they learned , and how to understand problems with understanding and change
so that 's what makes you all think more connected to the way we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my eye and the colleagues , i got to wonder , what if we could use computers that would take instead of a digital graph , and what if we could be
and this question was so so amazing that we decided to have to have the answer to the answer and they developed the answer .
in short , a game is a interactive computer in the size of one eye .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can pick your movements and you can get a screen and a trick .
much more important : are they 're really physical , why are they just only to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be their hands .
and the eye is an example of a new generation of education to the museum of a new digital digital data .
and if these tools are being able to get rid of , and to develop a change for your movements , each other points and see each other eye with them , then we can start with a new new eye with a new and open to a new
i 'm going to start with some simple examples .
this is the eye for the presence and when i go to a direction , the video is coming , and if i go to the other direction , it 's going backwards .
and these emotional portraits are taking true of one .
so if i turn out , it will come in interest .
if you are surrounded , you notice that and you can get nervous .
and they are also feeling their movement and get their movement .
now , an interesting impact of interactions we started , was that we could apply everyday ink on data , like color as well as well .
in this case , we 're going to the online eye , and i can use them to square color in the middle where they 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
if we 're going to stay , we can do a little bit .
there are also some great opportunity in education as we 've been talking about mathematics or mathematics , where we want to give people to people , we want to give the possibility of the moment , and the results want to see the results .
here i 'm -- this is a company that i 'm doing with a simple eye design .
this is a game that is a sort of a kind of metal that is made and the eye is .
basically , you get every video every time on every one at the letters , and as you try to form words , it literally will work over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , and then do it , and you get a new challenge and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on the media lab lab . i could move them to try and put it together and put a video .
they really loved it .
and an interesting thing to be in this type of applications is that you do n't have to be in people many of these kinds of applications .
all you say , `` is , `` do words '' and you know exactly what to do .
so here 's a couple of people that test .
this is our ancestors here at the right right on the right .
it turns out he was going to be at the time that he was only trying to cut the eye .
so for him , they were just the chinese stations .
this is an interactive trick .
we wanted to develop some online to technology .
that 's blowing into it .
it can bring new characters into the scene by looking at the table of the table that shows this character .
here he is doing the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he 's going to show you a game in the scene .
the top thing are coming in .
good work ! yeah !
by using it , by the time , shake the eye , and she 's going to turn it out , and he can interact to the characters ...
... was to invent your own story .
hello !
it 's a story at a button , and he can decide how it evolved .
flying cat .
the last example of that , for this i 've been doing , is a game for business that we 've developed recently , and in the order of the eye , like sound , like the ones , to continue to it ,
each has got four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can put that sounds into the sequence that you can see in any patterns .
and you do them by having a stick to a eye .
there are effects that you can change live , like , like , `` it 's called filters .
you get together with a certain sound , and then you put it to the drawing .
and then even more effects , like the speed and the light that you do in the entire sequence .
so let 's look at this .
we start in thinking of where we 're going to be in two people 's eye and a half of these things in a series of these things , they 're going to fly and add a little bit more the voice .
now i put a ride .
now i 'm going to have done some of the privilege to do this .
and now i 'll just get the filters with the steel industry , so i 'll control the effect of the effect .
i can go down the whole sequence of the whole sequence , by going to work into the speed of other direction .
and i 'll just hook the window that have a little bit up with the vehicle ; for something more expression .
i can be in the sequence as you 're born with evolution .
i do n't have to plan in the front plan , but can be careful ; they were more innovative or killed .
and finally , i can see all the whole sequence by using the eye to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new skills that can actually look better to the idea of how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to tell you some part of this new eye game and show some of the ways that we 're working in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you the way is that we are at this new generation of the eye with digital media , the information in our world that are worth our needs .
thank you .
i 'm very pleased to make myself all !
