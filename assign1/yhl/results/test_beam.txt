and as steve voices , performance of los angeles times , one day through los roads of los angeles . he heard a wonderful music .
she came by a man , a common , engineer , homeless , homeless , who played out of a rock that had only been two years .
many of you will know the story because there 's been a book later ,
solly went into , and he went to the interview , and 30 years , he was lived as memory in the streets around the center of los angeles .
now , i 'm very much to read all of you to read the book , or look to the movie so you do n't just understand the wonderful things between these two guys , but also how to make this link , and as you can finally ,
so i met california contact at 2008 , two years ago , in the effect of disney asia .
he was just heard of the end of the street first , and a global puzzle , and i came out of the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very walk and his serious summer and la clinton and how the air could never create it into the classic world of over top , and the whole one because of the eye is on the last sentence in the last sentence .
we came to speak with music . and we get a email later , and i was getting an email in which he said that was interested in writing with me for surgery .
i have to mention even a medical treatment of a medical treatment , because it 's already used to it and be treated with them , a passionate that he has taken it to be his whole life .
now , when a result of this , he 's particularly active for those signals , and those are sometimes bad , and it 's days to go on days , in the streets , and the
and in fact , in the exact part of the eye , when we started moved around with our first time ,
he was talking about how invisible works and smoke , and it 's a little bit of how somebody wanted to go on to sleep .
i had scared , i 'm not afraid , i could lose him that he might destroy them in his own school , and i could destroy him his relationship with the company , if i start to talk about
so i just started playing .
i played the first call of street .
and while i was played , i noticed that in the end of a result ,
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose play was my game .
so , you 're at understanding to you , you see , you 're in understanding , you know , in terms of being curiosity and diabetes .
and like a miracle took his apartment and started to play some of the game , and she asked me to play her to play . okay .
and we started talking about music , starting from the stream of their face , right , and all the other ones , to get from them up to go out .
and i realized that he 's not just knowledge about music on music , and it also would have a hard personal relationship for him .
he talked about her with her an passion and an understanding that i would just know of my colleague from my colleagues from los angeles .
by being asked music , he was saying about music , was made by this eye , writing man who was led through the streets of los angeles to a room , a computer game ,
music is medicine . music changes us .
for example , we have music and music , music , music .
because music allows him , his thoughts and forced with the help of his imagination , creativity in something of life .
and he would have a big states of the united states .
i understood that this is actually the most art of art .
so this is exactly why we make music music , so that we can do something that 's all of us to be a deep deep thing in the inside , and our feelings , through our creation , through the creativity of creativity we can .
and the reality of the words are all about us , and it moves , inspired us .
what happens out , and so it took him back the music back into a community of friends .
the eye 's force took him back into a family of the canopy , who understood it and looked at it .
and i 'm always gon na show up with me , and if you look at the effect of the impact party hall , or on it , because he reminds me why i am a musician .
thank you .
bruno mitchell : thank you . thank you .
robert means means .
robert : i want to play something i do .
i hope you 'll take me about me .
so i 've been most known in my life there in my life .
i 've only had two letters .
this first , it was more like a boring movie .
it was a beautiful fish , the software , good brand , software , a blue brand on the airport .
what a fish .
and better , it has been limited to think of thought of to think of the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about it , you could feel about it .
i had a very beauty with several months .
and one day the head of a company is to ask if i could be a event about the sustainability of the farm .
`` of course , '' i said .
here , a company trying to solve what this product problem has been for us is , how do we train fish on our lives ?
in the last 50 years , we 've got killed the oceans as well as we make forests seriously .
it 's hard for the destruction to cooperate .
90 percent of these big fish who we love , the average ones that we love the ones , the eye , the right , the ones , the ones , the right , they were collapsed .
it 's almost no longer left .
so , perhaps , you know , it 's going to be in the numbers of things , is part of our future .
and many of the people that live there . there 's the environment that you think most of you are much of times , and they 're resilient , they take them down . a big deal .
he has one for one of the 15 .
that means that it 's 15 pounds of fish , so you get a tree .
not very sustainable .
also not extremely good .
so here 's one company that was trying to get it right .
i was going to smell it .
and the day in the event , i was called the head of birth to the company .
let 's call it to him .
`` yo '' and i said , `` only to have the way to the facts '' and you are famous for that far in the ocean , you do n't make the environment . ''
`` it 's true , '' he said , `` we 've gone out there that the sheep will run our fish away . ''
and then he 's going , `` we are basically a personal world .
so , these are the presence of a button , and he said he said .
`` the best thing . ''
let 's go to one , great , bad .
`` you know what ? what was you going to do ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' said .
`` great '' i said . he put up .
and at that night , i was in the bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event to , i called a short ago .
i said , `` excuse me , for example , is sustainable proteins ? ''
he said she did n't do that . he 's going to walk care .
now , i 'm looking at a couple of people in the company , nobody was able to give me an original answer , and i finally started to finally set up to the charter .
we also call him , as a result .
`` yo '' and i said , `` what 's a sustainable proteins ? ''
now , he mentioned some of the water and some of the eye , and he said he said , `` you know . ''
i 'm like , `` okay ? ''
and he said , `` yes , drink , skin , flowers , food and a food . ''
i said , `` how much percent is chicken about chicken ? ''
perhaps two percent ,
`` well , it 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said to say , `` yo , what is sustainable on fish to feed chicken ? ''
there was a long job in the line and he said , `` there 's just a lot of the chicken on the world . ''
i 'm going to make this fish .
no , do n't not because i 'm a trick and make you feel like i am .
that 's me , too .
no , i actually have a trick by that fish , because i quit the fish after chicken .
the second fish , that 's a different kind of sight .
it 's the romantic species , the way you see your fish , you 're going to love the fish anymore .
i 've been eaten with him first in a restaurant .
one of a remarkable had talked for a long time .
it 's kind of a lot .
he came up at the table with a light , almost a very strange white white white .
the music had to get him to him .
stop twice .
