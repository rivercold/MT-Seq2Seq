with the help of working video videos , which were made of paper , david , to us lead to us , we know , we know , we walk down to the enemy , cognitive , soft and most beautiful signs of the oceans , where life is
david ford : this is bill days . and i 'm 21 mandela .
we 're going to tell you some of the stories about the sea in heaven .
we 've got some of the most amazing images of the titanic you 've ever seen and , and we wo n't show you any of them .
the truth are that the titanic -- though it 's all her , it 's not on -- not the most exciting history from the sea .
i think it 's the problem for us to do the ocean .
when you think of it , the ocean is about 75 percent of the planet .
most of the earth 's ocean water is ocean water .
the average depth is about three kilometers .
part of the problem is we 're looking at at the beach , or images like this one , and you see it on the vast blue blue blue and you put it up and move there , and there 's waves ,
in the oceans , there are the longest members of the planet .
most of the animals live in the oceans .
most of the wars and of course in the sea are playing in the sea -- at the bottom of the sea .
some of the things is the diversity of the world and the density of life on the ocean is higher than in the rainforests .
most of them is , and yet there are some words like this that would take us and make us practice with it .
but when you stand on the beach , i want you to think of to stand on the edge of a visual world .
we have to share a very specific technique to get into this golden world .
we use the wall and cameras cameras , and we 're taking cameras , and these cameras have developed , bill , with the help of the help of columbia .
now you know , `` well , you 've never been able to make the true perspective here that you have new countries , but it 's got new eyes . ''
the people who have done with us , gave us new jobs , not just to see what exists , the new countries on the sea sea -- but also to think about life on the planet .
this is a number of death .
it 's part of my prediction because it 's got all sorts of work .
it turns out to be the largest creature in the ocean .
it 's going to have up to about 50 feet long .
do you see all of the different pieces ?
that 's how i like .
it 's got these kinds of taken down the sky . it 's moving up .
it 's got some of the things that do .
it 's a commercial animal .
these are all individual creatures that are going to make a organism in this one organism .
and it 's on front of these graphs at front that it used in the moment , and a little light .
if you take all of these large fish and control and all that takes up , one side of the scale , and every one side of all the things on the other side , you win down here .
most of the boreal in the sea is made out of creatures like this .
here 's the death death .
they 're using the glass of looking at the area of the time that you can do , again , to attract and to a second .
we 'd never have time to show them all the way to the power .
it 's all you 're going to be completely different and shapes .
bill long : we 're very surprised that the sea at the average of death is deep , and that we really know animals that live in the top of a hundred feet , but what the bottom thing is us not familiar with it .
these animals are living in a three-dimensional room , a driver , which we did not even have before .
you hear from the cameras and so something , but some of these animals are going to be going to be about 50 feet long .
you know very little at them .
dg : this is one of them , is one of the lessons , because it 's smaller , in it .
you can actually go through your head with your head in .
and here he is doing , it 's with the ears , and goes very expensive to the top .
we find them in all the deep and even deep into the most deep .
they 're from a few inches up to a couple of feet .
they get up to the gas -- they come to the window and look from the skin .
it 's a personal world in the globe and we 'll give you two show .
so in that case , we 're moving through the bottom , and see the creatures to the bottom of creatures .
this is a kind of analogy .
this one looks like incredibly in the kind of unbelievable , kind of , like this .
and here 's an favorites of my favorites . what a face !
what you see here is this really scientific data .
it 's pictures that we have done to breathe .
and this really is something that 's bill power , researchers with the first images of power of these animals , in their natural environment .
they do n't catch them in a net .
you can see it in that world in this world .
we take a group , sitting on the computer on the computer , and then it fly the user , and it 's gone to the planet and flying around the planet .
we 're going to watch the fastest back back , a 3,000 mile in a kilometer long .
the average depth at the top of the death is about about a mile on top .
now we 're over the atlantic -- there 's the back -- you 're going to go out , you know , to go out into where you go out and come in the middle of the pacific , nine degrees in the middle of the pacific .
we create maps of these mountain mountain and the help of sound , new , and that is one of these mountain mountain .
so we 're coming around a cliff here right on the right .
the height of this mountains on both sides is bigger than the taliban are in most cases .
and there are tens of thousands of mountains out out there , which are n't being stopped with one map .
this is an x-ray ridge .
we 're going to go and further further and deeper .
and finally , we come up with something like this .
this is an image of our robot -- he 's called it .
you can sit in a room like this , and you can put a piece of a character and a robot and you get a robot in the bottom of the sea around the sea .
so , among other things , we are trying to do our partners in social , this virtual world -- this world , to get this organic area -- in the lab .
because we are seeing just a watch on it .
we 're either taking them sound , or video , and with chemical sensors , but we 're not going to put the pieces together , we did n't go to another image together .
here 's where bill 's cameras is doing .
this is called a local source of this .
and here is a cloud from a cloud that has water cost water from an enormous sea on the bottom of the sea , on the bottom of the sea .
it 's going to go up by 300 degrees centigrade .
so this is all of the water under sea -- two , three , 4 miles at deep .
we knew we already knew in the '60s and '70s that was going to be on .
so , we had a clue that there 's this organization along this axis , because if there 's
we were n't aware that this is so rich in the crowd of being rich .
we did n't know about these things that we call `` mountain wars . ''
this is one of these hydrothermal vents .
300 degrees hot water come from earth .
on both sides , mountain , which are higher to the supply , so that this area here is a very dramatic .
bl : the white line is a plants that has brought out with 55 degrees centigrade .
dg : i find one of the biggest stories that we 're discover on the ocean is that the first thing we find after a face to the bottom of bacteria .
we asked ourselves , `` how do you get all the there down ?
now , we 've figured out that you 're probably likely to get from the planet .
they do n't just get off of the earth -- from the dead community -- they 've come back , bacteria support these colonies in life .
the pressure here is 800 pounds per square meter .
it 's a big number to three or five miles below the surface , not your face to go up here .
all the energy that drives these creatures comes from from earth -- so well .
and you can see how the life 's life here .
these are worms in worms , and that 's how we 're here .
bl : those worms have no scary . they have no mouth .
but they have two kinds of protection .
one for oxygen and the other side of the water , the other one , is this line of bacteria that have the ultimate fluid , the hot water that you saw out of the ground -- as well as simple sugar that you can .
dg : they can see -- this is a crab that live down there .
it 's taken a play of these worms .
