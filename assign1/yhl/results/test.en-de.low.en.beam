and as steve training , apparently the los angeles times , one day through los streets to the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
and she came away from a man , a coffee , engineer , broccoli , homeless , who was playing on one restaurant , who had only two years to have two years .
a lot of you will know the story , because of paper , you 've got a book later , and again a book , which was
solly went to go back and went to the interview , and 30 years later , it was lived as memory in the streets of the center of los angeles .
i 'm very much to read all of you , and we 're looking to read the film so you do n't just get the wonderful glasses between these two men that you have , but also the idea that the music was to make it and
i met frank contact in 2008 two years ago , in the effect of the effect , `` i follow . ''
he just had heard a fan of the street first , and monkeys heard behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very eye , and he 's a lot of sound of the book , and la clinton and la clinton , and he was just like the sum that he never would never do it in the classic world , and this is all because
we came to talk about music . and a couple days later , i was born an email in which we 'd think that was interested in writing with me .
i have to mention more , that sugar has been an final treatment , because it was already used to it and have been treated with it and it had been treated with the eye and it 's being treated , a genius that has been taken his life
as a result , he 's really particularly active to these signals , which are sometimes evil , and he 's talking about six days in the street , and the people 's mind in the streets , and the
and in fact , in fact , in the same time that we started in mit when we were talking about our first day in the effect room , they began to start started started , he 's just simply lost white in his eyes and just lost .
he talked about invisible hall and smoke and about it , like someone wanted to slow him in sleep .
i had scared , but i was afraid that he could destroy him in his own states , and that i could destroy his relationship to
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first sentence of street .
and as i was playing and i was born , that in the way , that you have a full bit on the same way .
it was as if he was under a invisible position , a chemical reaction that was my game .
so you 're looking at anger in understanding , in terms of curiosity and diabetes .
and like a miracle took his apartment and started to play some of a look and asked me , to play them to be : okay , you know .
and we started talking about music , we started to go on to you know , you know , go from all the other microscope up to yourself up to yourself .
and i realized that he was n't just knowledge about music for music , but to make it a strong personal relationship .
he talked about her a passion and a understanding that i would just know of my colleague from my colleagues in the border of los angeles .
by being asked music , he talked about music and talked about this game , and the fellow man , which was led through the streets of going on los angeles , a coffee game , you know ,
music is art . music changes us .
for us , it 's been music , and music became that 's `` music , '' music .
and the music allows to him , the thoughts , and forced with help his imagination and creativity .
and then it 's got to a lot of them .
and i understood that this is exactly the most art of the art .
and that 's what we 're doing music , so that we can do something that is going to be a very deep place in the inside , our feelings through our artistic lens through how to shape our creativity .
and reality is the word word , all of us , moving us , inspired , and we put it together .
what 's a lot of death away , so it brought him back to a community of a community of friends .
the game 's music brought it back into a family of a family in mind , who understood him that they realized in and looked at it .
and i 'll go back to a long music music , and if you 're able to look at the effect of the effect , i say , if i go to go up , or in your own row , because he reminds me why i am a
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
sebastian betti means .
robert t : i want to play something that i 'll do with the holy vagina .
so i hope you 'll talk about me experiment .
so i knew many fish in my life .
i have only two loved loved ,
this first , which was more like such a passionate movie .
it was a beautiful fish ,
so , what a fish .
and better better , it was in the presence of the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel with you to sell it .
i had a beauty had a relationship over several months .
and one day of the head of company called her head and asked whether i could have a event , could be the sustainability of the farm .
`` obviously , i said , `` of course . ''
here 's a company who was trying to figure out what this product problem was for our wedding , how do we fall fish on our lives ?
in the past 50 50 years , we 've done more , we have killed the oceans as we are doing forests ,
it 's hard to get the destruction to cooperate .
90 percent of the big fish who we love , the apple , the ones the eye , the eye , the ones , the ones , the right , they were closed .
there 's almost nothing left left .
so , you know , or bad is there , the other one , part of us to be a part of our future .
many people go to . they 're fighting the environment , most of them anyway , and you are in gas , they take clean down . a big ring .
he has one of the eye from one 15 .
that is , 15 pounds of fish are needed to get so you .
not very sustainable .
also not very good either .
so here was finally a company who tried to make it properly .
i was wearing them .
the day before day , i called the head of the birth to the 1990s for a company .
let 's call it to it 's a guy .
`` upwake , '' i said , `` only to have the facts right to the facts , there 's so far from the sea that you 're not sure of the environment . ''
`` right , '' he said , `` it 's so far , and we 're out of that , that the waste will be distributed off of our fish , not focused . ''
and then he 's going , `` we are basically a family world .
so you can say that you can go from one into the game , and he said he said .
`` the best in industry . ''
let 's go with you . great .
let 's do one what caused your ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' said .
i said `` great '' ; you put out .
and at this evening i got in bed , and i thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day and just before i had a little day , i call a short day .
i said , `` k , what 's sustainable machines ? ''
he said , he does n't do it . he 'll get care .
now , i started playing with some people in the company , no one could give me a three-dimensional answer ,
and i also call it a result .
`` upwake '' i said , `` what 's a sustainable proteins ? ''
now , he said , some of them mentioned , and some of you mentioned , and he told me , and then he said to me .
i said , `` are you ? ''
he said , `` yes , the arts , skin , flowers , the skills and it 's a food . ''
i said to say , `` how much percent do you get chicken ? ''
perhaps two percent .
`` well , this is roughly 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` i said , what is sustainable about fish in fish ? ''
there was a long and a long job of the line and he said , `` there is just too much chicken on the world . ''
i am looking at this fish .
no , do n't , because i 'm a trick and make you go .
that 's me , actually .
no , i was actually able to go through that fish from this fish , because , i quit a fish , the fish , to chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of a favorite .
it 's romantic 's way of doing the way you 're learning with your fish , you 're going to see the fish anymore .
i first have eaten him in a restaurant .
one is a big journalist ever talked about this fish for a long time .
it 's kind of a lot .
he came up on the table with a light of the light , almost it 's a lot of weird white white white .
the chef had a head to him .
hold around .
i mean , i did n't have it in fact , he had still been a invitation .
who can give a copy so hard after him become a while ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call it to him . actually , he 's married .
and no , he did n't have the fish , and he is not a chef ; at least in the same way you and i understand .
he 's a set in there , with his la trick .
this is a trick that 's next at home .
it 's close around the flow of the river .
until the month , i had the farm in the farm was the farm .
they were born the eye on what it was like in the world .
they did that by doing the country in the country .
they built these complicated tools , and they smell water out of the land and out the river .
well , they could n't make sure that 's happening .
and so , of course , it was a disaster .
and it took about 90 percent of the birds in which for these place , they are many birds .
and so , brazil has bought a small company with dinner bought the country .
what did you do ?
you have the flow of the water , you have the river .
they literally , literally , they literally stick .
instead of the water used to use them , they used the cancer cancer water , and back to the water back back water again .
they are among the channels .
you 've created a billion cotton party -- you 've created the skills , rich , the elephant , and you 've got married company , and your company have green destruction completely the other way around .
the shower is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this .
and what you look at is on the horizon , which is a million miles away from , and all you are in the eye and these waste , and these waste , the golden matrix .
i was not a long long time before .
he is an incredible guy , three parts of charles , and a part , he looks like `` a tiger for the fish . ''
okay ? that 's what we 're and focused on the tracks and i go through and go to my school school , and we 're going to have a trick to some eye on a trick .
so here he 's a rare trick .
now he came out of moving up .
and here , it is , you can see , you see the pattern of stockholm that reminds him to the smart economy .
it 's out that nasa of his career has spent its career at the national park in africa .
i asked him that he had become such like this .
he said , `` a fish ? i do n't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then he goes , and it 's going to be in more rare birds and drug and strange strange eyes .
and you do n't get me wrong , which was really fascinating you know , the smallest community , like the way that 's the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this eye for her fish that i had at the giant piece of thousands of fish that i had on the tracks .
so i got out of him . i said , `` no , how does it happen your fish did so good ? ''
he showed up at the client .
`` i know , oh , boy , who are moving up , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what are your fish ?
how do you know ? ''
now he 's going to tell me that there is a strange system , that the fish , what they were going in the wild .
it 's called the walls , the ones , that is what the fish are doing .
the system 's so healthy ; it 's totally helpful .
there 's no food diet .
the story of a farm , is that the animals are not going to smoke up their animal ?
and then , at the day , i was going through this site with india 's time , and i asked him , and i was like , `` for a place which looks like so , '' different than any farm i 've ever been , ''
the moment was , it was like a given hit a trick .
and we took it around the corner and we looked at the most amazing a film , thousands and thousands and thousands and tens of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people , we literally , literally , literally , literally , literally
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at her perspective , fire .
you do it .
do i ? was totally confused .
i said , `` you do n't say your fish ? do n't you do your fish ? ''
`` yeah . '' he said .
`` we 're losing 20 percent from our fish and turn on each other . ''
now , last year , i 've had a $ birds on this site more than 250 different species .
it 's actually the largest and one of the most important areas of private areas has become all of europe in europe .
i said , `` you ca n't argue , do n't the last last , who are you on a while of yourself ? ''
he plays his head , `` no . ''
he said , `` we do do it , do n't make sure about it . ''
this is a psychological network .
and then , you know , you know , the wings eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the temperature .
so , the hell of what is going on , is a better system of the system , is that it 's true of the system .
okay , let 's think of that . a farm , which your animals are not wearing and a farm , who 's called their success of their homes .
now there , but a trick .
oh , and the way , do n't even take those satellites of the mind .
they wave away from a city for a city and it 's better than it better for the nest industry .
every morning , they fly apart miles to farm .
and every evening , they went back miles miles .
they 're doing this because they can be white to white line of white line .
seriously .
i used to put some kind of journey on the penguins , so i looked at it .
i said , `` well , you 're going to fly away and fly miles up miles to a farm and do you take away miles and clean miles away at the evening ?
do you make that for the children ? ''
he looked like i was wearing a song from a song .
he said , `` no . you 're doing this because i 'm better to eat better . ''
i 've heard the skin of mine who was food , and i do not like any time , i do n't like it . i do n't like them like that .
it 's this reactor plan to taste .
i almost never . i do n't almost get to do it .
and yet , when i do it in the restaurant , it does n't even get them at any point to the time .
she liked sweet , and as if you were to take one out of the ocean .
i mentioned this to be married , and he 's getting away .
he said , `` the skin of this is like a nightmare .
she 's the last force before it in the body .
she evolved in the course of evolution , to go ahead . ''
and then he 's like , `` but we did n't get off the water . ''
okay . a farm , who your fish did n't catch fish . a farm , who are on their success on the success of its success .
and then i realized , well , when he said , a farm who has not a trick , and he says a lot because the water through this farm comes out of the river .
it 's a river that leads all the things that rivers these days tend to lead them , and they lead chemical , chemical radiation , depending on the eye .
and when it comes to the system , and this is that this leaves is that water is the water as how it is the eye .
so the system is so healthy , it does become water .
so not only just one farm , your animals do n't even know , do n't just have one farm , who 's literally a farm , but a woman who literally is to get a vote , and not only for those fish , but
because when the water is going to you go in the atlantic .
one drop in the oceans , i know -- but i do , i 'm going to take it , and i 'm supposed to do it , and i should do it , and that 's what they do too ,
you might say that you 're a recipe for the future of good food , whether we speak from eye or speech .
what we need now now is that radical new concept of agriculture , one , in the food actually has actually told well .
but for lots of people , it 's a little radical .
we 're not a designer designer , we 're going to go off . we 're in hollywood .
we love doing it . we love it . we are talking about local acids , we talk , food .
and if you claim that the things that the future of good food does n't think somewhere , and says , `` hey , man , i love the world , but how would they feed the world ?
how are they feed the world ? ''
will i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we 're creating enough fat to feed the world more than they feed .
one billion people will become today .
one billion -- it 's more than any of the time -- of the online monkey in the distribution of the distribution . it 's not before the oil .
now , i do n't like this question , because it has the implications of our presence that the last 50 years for the last 50 years .
occasionally , we 've got to get a block in organic , who , at anger , chemicals on the planet , chicken chicken , and all the time they asked them `` well , if we feed more people getting cheaper , how awful can it be that
this was the accident . it was the sounds . it has been the resistance of the american farming .
we should call them what she is , you should be a set of drug , an kind of thing that you 've seen , you know , quickly capital , that 's exactly the production of that .
this is not a science , and it 's not just agriculture .
our eye is not alone , not because of the power of the time , but for safety , it 's not by the safety of resources .
not by the latest game , but by 2050 , not to get out of cancer , but by fresh water , not through video , and not through all forests , but not through conflict , but through fish , with fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
so let 's start with question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how are we going to use conditions to feed any community , to feed themselves ?
to do that , look at the presence for the future .
it 's really old , and this is done .
capital , chemistry and machines are the ones , and it has never been an good good food .
let 's take a look instead of the green problem .
this is this , which is about two billion years of light .
look at you , you look at one of , farmers like earth .
the company who are n't worlds , companies who are not in charge of cells , businesses that grow up instead of all hard , farmers , who are not surprised , but experts do n't just waste for relationships , but is experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also on flavor .
and when i really say , well , you know , if i 'm honest , it 's an better chef than i 'm going to be .
you know , that 's my right , because when that 's the future , it 's good food , you 'll be delicious .
thank you .
so if i want to ask you today today , i want to ask you that the full of data that we consume is more bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking ,
so , what we 're seeing here is a bit of writing in age old .
the program i 'm using is a little experiment .
it 's called the mind and what i 'm going to be able to translate to you and say to you for some basic being , say , we say we say .
and immediately , i can see a different pattern that makes me point .
and it 's because , there are the people who are in the game here are people over there and you are over here over here .
we can take one step further and then going to take the data , and we can see that that 's cancer that is the normal pain , but everybody is not any for everyone .
now , if we 're now in moving and a little bit , we see 40 years or we see , in italy , we have the cause that 's actually talking about the cause of people who need to worry about it .
and who sees the end is particularly true to men .
so they realize that the look at information and the data that 's happening in that way of swimming in its way .
and if we do it for data , why not too for content ?
so what we are now doing here is we are now doing each individual of the individual eye that we 've ever ever had before .
it 's all over here . it 's all online .
they 'd like to test it after the talk of talk on to her talk .
you can get you back to a square decade .
they can pull around a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
now , if i look like i look at this here , i look like the tsunami that i come to this copy , and the one .
i 'm a jewish fan game play , so i 'll immediately leave all over the fact of all robots , i 'm talking to you speak of this session .
now , if i 'm only trying to get away what i could like , `` okay , okay , what if i 'm going to look about everything with the subject of this subject ? ''
so i 'm going to go back and take the perspective .
now , i 've been surprised by the right game .
and so you get an idea that when you look at information , you can go ahead and go around , a little bit , you know , you do n't want to go or not off what it is n't easy or do n't just do it .
you make it a slightly different thing .
it 's something in between , and we 're thinking about the way that we think about information is used .
so this idea i want to take a little bit further from what a little crazy is crazy .
what we did here is we took each individual and reduce them in a little bit of a line of click .
the theory contains a quick basis and a symbol for the inside of that it comes from .
i 'm just going to just get the top that most 500 of the most time in the most time .
and even in these angeles , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a sense of the issues which are based on wikipedia at the most amazing .
so i 'm going to choose some issue with you .
now , after i was so , i think that the game that i think of this is , most of it , most of this , `` people put out time , '' `` people for the year . ''
so , this really matters , because this is a insight that 's not in a single trick .
that 's just when you take a step in a step and look at the whole one .
so , energy in a certain game , i can go into the theme , and i can go , `` the human man of the year , '' and see everybody can see together .
now , if i look at these people all of these guys , i know that the majority of those are you , and some are coming in science . some of them are still coming out of the economy , and here 's my boss , and
and interestingly , a ted woman 's a ted prize .
so we can jump through now and we 've done this kind of a look at all ted to this month .
you see , we 're in the web first of the very first time , as if it 's a net , not just to go from him , but much more likely .
and so i 'd like to show you what might be a little surprise .
and i just show you just the new york times website .
so this is a network -- i 'm not going to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser but you can go and take pressure so you and we 'll bring it to every single website like this .
so i can go back one step , and right into a particular conflict .
so that 's why it 's very important because you just have to look through the level of pressure in this kind of way in that way you can think about it in this same way .
i can sort of can go in my view of video war , in a certain view of war in my view .
here 's the state of all the story i 've been talking about it .
and i can do anything i 've been looking at today again .
and if i go back to step up a step and look like everything , i can look at my view of a little bit of time , maybe i can get my eye , and here i was looking for you , here
and here i can get into the side and put them up again .
it 's a metaphor which is used all over again , and every single time it does to do that bigger than to control the sum of the data .
now , in the world right , the world is that data is a form of data .
we 're talking about the act of the eye .
we 're talking about `` independent in information . ''
what if we could turn up this situation , and then the internet on their head is that we rather do n't want to go from one to another start now , from a lot to many things , and can see patterns which otherwise would have been before
if we can do this , this is the teaching 's going to , maybe a new source of human information .
and instead of moving just into information , we can know know that .
and if we know what we can learn , maybe we can even get out of it .
i 'm listening with that , thank you .
i grew up on the very simple serious science of science fiction .
i went to school with a bus of school every single hour per day .
and my nose was put in a book , a trick that my thoughts in other worlds , and in a way , it 's kind of deep in my mind .
and that curiosity showed me that when i was n't in school through the forests , went to go through the walls and say , `` you know , `` you '' and it 's all
i was totally okay , do you know .
it always went around trying to understand the world and to get the boundaries of the possible shift .
and my love of science is in my environment because the late city , we went to the moon , we saw the deep floor of the deep floor of the deep floor .
the vertical insight came into our room with his amazing shows , which were our animals and showed us our animals and the world of full world , which we 've never had ever imagined of us before .
so that 's actually good at that online to get the end of that online .
and i was artists .
i was drawing . i was able to shoot .
and because of games , there are no eye at video films , i 've got a whole lot of the total of the landscape in the media landscape , and i had to create images in my head .
and we all had to read this back . if we read the children a book , we took the description of the test and we got it on our heads in our heads .
my response to the country and looked at the drawing and the glass of brain worlds , and robots and all the things that we do .
in a hospital , i was moved to the teachers as i was ,
creativity had got to be outside .
and something interesting was interesting , which is what i was fascinated on the art eye voices , the idea of the idea was in our earth , in our earth itself .
i 'm never never going to get an airplane world with an airplane in oxford , which is quite unlikely by my mind .
but here was a world that i could come in , right here on the earth , and it was also fascinating and air as all of this , which i had always been met when i read that books .
so i decided when i was 15 .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , 18 miles from the next ocean removed .
i 'm not doing that , but i do n't want to call any of them .
i 'm reading my father , i finally finally made one at the time , new york , of course , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my eye in the top of the front of the time in the winter of war , new york .
but the ocean -- i got a real ocean , and i got two years later later on when we moved to california .
since then , 40 years since the 40 years , i spent about two inches in the water for about 500 hours of this .
and i have learned the world deep , even in the front oceans , is so rich in love , the way we really can think of it .
the way of nature is not going to know borders , and as much of our own , is to get human human imagination .
so , i think , up for the days days , i think , `` i do see some of the papers for what i see on my ear . ''
and i love my love on the ocean with the same kind of thing about and ever .
so when i get an adult a job , it was the interview .
and that seemed the best way to make me create my inner mind , to create my need to create pictures .
as a child , i was working in my own books and so forth .
so movies were the way of the way , they were images and the stories of intelligence . it would happen together .
of course , the stories i would show out was the name of his mind , `` `` `` the `` `` `` child '' , `` `` the brain '' and called `` is . ''
`` do i could use my daughters for the heavens and the way it would be with the eye .
so my two enemies are like me to turn up my two two .
something interesting happened to be a `` eye , '' to solve a game for a game of that film -- and that 's what we had to create a kind of a small way with it -- we found it on multiple animation , go back .
what it came out was the first one of the first eye who was ever seen inside a movie .
the film made no money in , and he 's just seen it just a fascinating : the audience in the earth were led to the whole world by the magic of magic .
according to arthur designers , it 's law , is how technology 's technology and calls no longer any of them .
so you saw something magic .
and i found really exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , it must be involved in the standard . ''
and so we went to `` industrial 2 , '' my next film , still on .
so , together we put up the guys 's guys from liquid networks , the success was to really get out of how this effect was going on .
and it worked . again , we 've created something called magic . the impact in the audience was exactly the same , but we already have a little bit more a little more money .
so these two experiences , it 's a whole new world to reach a whole new world of creativity in creativity .
so , i started a company , together with my great friend of russia who was the best to the best eye , and she was called `` digital eye . ''
the idea of this company was it , the led
we 're going to do that and we 're going to be able to make us like that .
but the 1990s in the 1990s is we found that we knew that in the business , and we actually had the company in this company , too slowly .
and i wrote this piece called `` avatar , '' which wrote the head of the things , to the effects of a new day of impact with some of the human human , cognitive characters that had been made by online , and the world should be
but the air keeps up beautiful , and people in my company told me that we still have n't been able to do that yet .
so i created that , made this other film about the big ship .
the trick is , as i was sold , `` looking at , `` do , '' and i sold in a ship , '' and it 's been a game of `` well , '' a scary movie .
and i 'd really wanted that to the real date i want to stand up the real drop of the titanic .
so i did the film .
this is the truth . the first studio did n't know , but it did n't .
but i think by saying , `` we 'll go out to the train board . we 'll watch the actual knee .
we 're going to show it in the position of the movie film .
it 's important . it 's a good ring for marketing . ''
and then i make them pay a coward to pay .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to the end of the own imagination , it can create a reality .
we actually created a lot of six months later in which i found myself in a russian interview , four miles under the surface of north asia , and
this is not a movie , no war , that was real .
so , that 's what really happened about me .
and they 've been doing all the food that they had to do cameras , and we had to make all of them , and everything else we had to build .
and i 've noticed how much of these eye skills , which is a trick .
well , they were also so responsible with planning .
you go up into this street , and then you go into this dark , amazing environment where no hope are n't going to get on , not if you 're not going to get back to yourself .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's as if i 'm in a film .
this is real cool , right now . ''
and i was really obsessed with the study of islands .
anyway , the part of the part who has to do curiosity and science . it was . it was an curiosity , it was funny . it 's imagination .
and it was an experience that was not able to let me hollywood .
because , because i , you know , so i could think , i could imagine a creature that we would then could be able to do , but i could n't see what i 'm going outside to see outside the window .
and in a few of the world i have seen this , i saw a lot of them , and sometimes things that i 've never been seen before , sometimes the things that no one had ever seen before .
so this is really , in me , really , i wanted to do more .
so i met with one particular choice .
after the success of the success , i told myself , `` ok , i want to go out to my business in hollywood in hollywood and i 'll turn it for a while . ''
and then we started to then , we started , `` smell , '' and we made them laugh .
we went back to the top of the titanic ,
we took little robots that had built that we had a trick .
our intent was to go out , and look at the inner ship by which never was before .
nobody had ever collapsed the inside of the trade , and you did n't have a means for that , so we developed the advantage of technology .
well there , i 'm going to see , on the top of the titanic , in a interview , and see you see that the eye here are pretty , right , and i know that the band played there in there .
and i went through a tiny eye by the bottom of the ship .
i do n't think it 's a lot , but my mind is within your vehicle .
it felt like i was able to put together in the front with the front of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of the trick i 've got ever . because before i was doing each series of the corner , i always knew what 's the same show for the car , because i had taken the film
and that was , the top was a pretty copy of the glass of the ship .
so this is a pretty strange experience .
she made me realize that they use such eye and use their consciousness to the vehicle in the car , into the other form of the existence of the existence .
it was really exciting .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in some decades , if you 've got to be able to do something like , to do something else , in all ways i can think of myself .
so , after this project , we started what we 've seen down to learn , really , to learn for example , which is where we saw these incredibly powerful animals , but these are sort of , but here we have on top .
they 're living in the help of pittsburgh .
they do n't exist in any of the system , how do we do that .
and this is how you animals with animals that are directly on a 500 degree c that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in the same time that was the eye of my childhood .
and i ended up with the people who are interested in space and sit with nasa and
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was out that i took it into the deep floor .
i took them with you to the world there , down , and are , you know , in those people who 's been interested for such extreme situations , and i took them into the sources of so they could take around it ,
we were able to go on , but , really , science said , `` okay . ''
so , in the circle between my existence , the time as a kid , and the branches in reality .
in the course of this condition , i learned a lot .
i 've taught a lot of science . i 'm certainly thinking to think there must be a instrument , too , too , too , to be a leader or something like that .
i understood not a lot of leadership before i get this thing .
because in a certain point i had to say to myself , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what does come out ? ''
these all the movies do n't bring a living experiment .
we 've just had the rise to the rise . it 's not a whole deal .
everyone , i 'm between david , and `` oops '' and i would have a little bit of this guy in a paper on the beach .
i 'd all these films , these things , for a very small audience .
no longer a market , no honor , no money . what do you do ? are you ?
you 're going to give it this to the task of the task to get the challenge -- and the ocean is the unknown environment that there has been there -- you 're going to take it at the eye because , and because of a small group of
because we 've done all this with just 12 to 12 people who have happened to have years ago . sometimes we 'd be put two to three months on lake .
and that in this community , you see the most important thing that you 've got before each one , because you have a task that you can not explain any other .
when you go to land and say , `` we 've got to do this , which is the end , and all of all around it , '' and the trouble , the human group , if you can not explain the other ,
there 's a connection that creates a connection , and there are some other respect .
so when i went back to , like my next film , `` i was able to do the same feature , '' and i was trying to apply the same group ,
and it really got changed dynamic .
so , i stood with a small team of a team of the team , a little team , i stood , `` i 'm called '' to call a new technique that has not been there before .
that 's exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were there for a real family at a real family .
and it changed my way to do that in the movies , completely .
there were people who said , we 'd like to do these guys , and went at the planet called top on .
for me it was , it was more a way to do my job , who changed my job , which was changed in the outcome .
so what can we end from all of that ?
what is the lessons that have you learned ?
i think curiosity is a curiosity .
it 's the powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and its team is crucial than all the world is the world .
to me , i was coming up with young a young , who said , `` give a advice of what i can do something like this . ''
and i 'm saying , `` you 're not going to be a self .
i have other people 's others . do n't talk to you , not against yourself , not against yourself . they 're very risks to risk you . ''
nasa has one such up , `` failure is no alternative . ''
but in art , what has got a alternative , it has to be there , because there 's where you get there .
no big dynamic , innovation has had innovation , has ever been ignored without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
so , this is the idea that i 'd like to give you away , and that is a alternative , it 's not a alternative . it 's not a alternative . thank you .
today , i am talking to you about energy and climate .
and perhaps you know , you 're going to be in the foundation at the foundation mainly to collect and seeds , to the things that we invent , and to provide for the poorest two billion two billion to make a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , in any other one other on planet .
so , with you not grow , you will grow over a while over a lot of years , it 's us , we 're too much , or too little , do you change things like that , or how much does n't make it place .
that leads . it leads to uncertainty . it goes into it .
so , the change becomes terrible for them .
the trick for you is very important .
in fact , if they could just reduce one of the price , you could say , you can get energy again more .
well , the trick is over time .
in fact , the eye is up .
the eye drive the industrial revolution in the 20th century itself , and so that was in the way , and that 's why we 've done some of the world , east africa , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so , we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- we make the prize down -- we 've got a new barrier and we moved together with co2 .
co2 , co2 , the planet and the equation for co2 is quite obvious .
they 're looking at the solar states that leads to the power , and there is a very fundamental consequences to the surface , and perhaps worse , and perhaps worse , and perhaps worse and worse , the natural forces that are not going to adapt to that
well , the same thing about the connection between the eye and the mind will follow and where you have some of them , but not very many of them yet , but not very many of them , but not quite a lot of them .
and there are just a little bit secure about how bad these consequences are : but they will be extremely bad .
i asked asked the way i asked : `` do we really have to come up to zero ? ''
does not matter to the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we come to zero , temperature is going to rise to zero .
so it 's a huge challenge .
it 's a very different way to say that we have a brilliant meter of high high truck out of a three meter bridge , and that 's what you can get into it to a three feet from it .
this is something that has to take down to zero .
well , every year , we 'll pull a lot of plastic into every year , over 26 billion tons of tons .
now , every americans americans do n't like 20 tons . people in poor countries have less than one .
it 's roughly five tons for everybody on planet planets .
and somehow , we must create changes that 's going to zero .
it 's so far at that point .
only different economic changes , all of it , are actually influenced , and we need to go down from giving out by the presence of population , and to zero to zero .
this equation , four factors , a little bit apart . they 've got this thing to be left -- co2 -- carbon -- that is to be able to bring them out of zero , and this will be by the number of people who 's going on
so let 's actually see each factor of what we get this to do that .
probably one of those numbers will come to zero .
now , this is basic stone , but let 's go it through .
we first do this , first of all .
today 's living billion living .
and it takes nine billion , and it 's going to move about nine billion .
if we 're very successful with the new atmosphere that we may think about 10 percent to 15 percent , but we see a combination of agriculture in the time .
the second is worth the services that we use .
this is all everything , the food that we eat , clothing , we
and these are very nice things , and they 're mean means to be able to make up their brain almost to each of the planet available to our planet .
it 's great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the top billion , you may be able to make even more connected and less , but in average , that number is going to go every year every year , and there 's a whole bit of times more than it ,
here we have a very clever service , and here 's the light at the light , so you can read the crime ?
and these students have not done it , and they go , and they read her english version .
now , in efficiency , the e and e , there 's some good news , finally , it 's good news .
we have something that 's not going up .
because of all these trends in the end of others , by new ways , there are a lot of services that are actually reduce by 90 services to 90 percent .
in other words , how can we allow to go from strangers , with the trick or so you can get a lot of little smaller to the eye , which is very much smaller .
in all , if we 're optimistic , we may get a increase by a factor of three or maybe , maybe , a factor of six .
but in the first three of these factors we 're now from 26 billion maybe now 13 billion tons . and that 's just not enough !
so let 's see what it 's a fourth factor to -- and this is what it will be , and that is the amount of co2 that is going to be able to be able to go through this .
and it turns out whether you can get this on zero .
if you ca n't burn you : no .
if they ca n't burn gas : no .
almost every time to the place for electricity today , it would be co2 , except to renewables and services .
so , what we need to do on a global level is we create a new system .
we need ta do the game .
now if i think of `` oh , '' and i do n't mean the impossible .
the price rate is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the dark services is a miracle .
and there are people here have a lot of these miracles .
there is usually not a lot that you need a wonder to a particular date .
and it 's usually just the second , and some people do n't .
but in that case , we need to put it out and we get a coffee in a short period of time ,
now i asked myself , how can i really get this ?
is there natural , a demonstration , is the idea of humans in the people here ?
i remember last and i think about last year when i got her and somehow liked the people in .
the idea was really having a clear , you know , there are people who live with empty life .
for energy , i 've got this one .
i decided that this was that that that i do was to do that i was making this problem of view of doing my eye to my game .
so here are a few natural spheres .
you told me she does n't drink them , in fact , they do n't look at the glass of leave .
now , there are all sorts of interaction like this , but they 're all making a lot .
we need solutions , either one or the one , the one , the one , the one bubble and rich , and although there are many directions that people are looking for , and in fact , i only could have five people who could afford five
i 've got sex , to go ahead and sticks , left together .
this is perhaps going to be able to do a pair of contribution and if you 're doing better than i expect , this is a great thing , but i 'm here , but i think i have to work on all of these five work ,
let 's first look at an fossil fossil fuels , and we 're looking at natural coal , or gas .
what you must do is easy to feel simple , but not it is not . you 'd have to get all of the carbon that you 're going to go from the rock , and then , you can get there somewhere , and
there are some % , which are on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it will be extremely difficult to get difficult to produce the size of co2 's a big challenge , but the biggest problem is the game here .
who will do that ?
who can do something that 's a little thing , which literally has a lot of billions better than any kind of waste you can possibly imagine ?
that 's a lot of paper business .
so that 's the tough knee .
next one : next thing .
they also have three big problems , the cost , especially in the developing countries , and the question for security , is that nothing can go , despite all , despite the human season , the cost of the fuel is being used for weapons .
what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of options .
so three very difficult problems that might be willing to work , and that you should work with this .
the last three , i saw the five three three three three .
they 're the fossil power as they often be called .
and even though , though it 's wonderful , you do n't need a matter -- they have some of the fuel objects .
one is the combination that allows creating these technologies that it made it down than we do .
these are eye , you 're talking about a lot , a normal force in a normal power force .
and also , were also made these grains of things that these sources of these sources of people are made .
the sun does n't seem to all the day ; it does n't seem to be any of every day and just the wind also not always always forever .
so you have to break out when you have on these sources of organization , a way that energy has n't available in time if you get it available .
now , there 's big eye skills . it 's important with you , and if we have to tell you , that the combination of the country is , you do n't just need the technology that you need to deal with the risk that the energy from
and there 's the trick .
and to show the dimension of the dimension , i have all been made all the different things that are made to be , as in the cars , computers , cell phones , for everything , and i 've
so what we need here is a big survey , something that will be a factor to be a factor more better than making access to time .
that 's not impossible , it 's not so easy .
that happens when you try to get these eye sources of using 20 percent -- 30 percent of them .
if you want 100 percent of being a breath , it 's really , you have to have an amazing computer computer attack .
now where should we go , what is the right way ?
how do we go to the target ?
so what we need is a lot of companies that work on this . hundreds of thousands .
in fact , we need to have 100 areas of 100 people .
many will say , they 're crazy . it 's good .
and i think there are a lot of this , in ted group there are already out there .
bill 's large has several companies , among other other companies , among other things , right ?
so you can invest in dozens of companies , you know , in dozens of companies companies , the great things are doing , and it has interesting opportunities , and i 'm trying to help that .
nathan left , and i have a company that may possibly give me the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations of it ; it gives you think , etc .
the development has gone away in that industry a couple of time , so it 's not great surprise that some good concepts in education .
that means , in fact , instead of a part of the system that you decided that we decided to separate 99 percent , which is the end .
that 's a really crazy idea .
but in fact , you had a long thought of about it , but you could n't
because these 99 percent is going to do is better for a lot better .
you 're in , actually , you will do the waste , and you 're able to use the sheep from what we use to do as well .
instead of it , and instead of it , they 'll burn it ; a great thing .
now , the indus script is actually actually using a little bit like a philosophy growth rate .
you can see that it 's a kind of interface , many times as `` as a `` `` looking of , '' you know .
and this really allows that as a result .
here 's an image of a place in kentucky .
this is the sheep , 99 percent , and so that 's going to be able to think about this .
the cost of the population for the hundreds hundreds of thousands of years .
and if you go to close and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges there , but it 's an example of a bunch of different concepts that we need to come forward .
let 's have measure how to measure our success .
what was the point of this ?
now , go to the target , we have to reach , and we 're going to talk about the eye .
many talk about 80 percent of them away by 2050 .
it 's really very important to get there .
the other 20 percent are being produced in poor countries , and still have some agriculture as well . so hopefully , is going to be clean down to the other .
so to reach these 80 percent , the world 's world has to get , including nations , like china , or so developing its eyes completely , completely evolution .
the other note says if we use the world technology to be whether they used to be used in all the developed countries , and we on the way we have to get to the rest .
that 's great important .
and that 's what 's going to share a key key to the eye .
if we go from there , what was the u.s. growing ?
it should be again again as again as again .
we should be able to use the time to get away in the way . the less we get off there , the whole temperature is going to be the ones , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is for the things that we have a company that does n't take completely to the great ones , just to make something less than the others that have been the sequence of innovation in the heart .
now , these characters , this graph , we need to follow with this kind of transport , and we can measure and measure , you know , in the business and go into it .
there 's many great books to this topic .
the al gore 's choice , `` david energy , ''
they really go through it , and they create a scale that they can be talking about all the time because we need support for all sides .
there are a few that 's coming to come together .
this is a wish .
a very common experience that we invent this technology .
if you take a wish for the nearest 50 years , i could pick the president , and the president i would say , or i could choose that wish ; it 's going on without co2 . i 'm going to take that wish .
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get that desire , it 's associated from the long time and of course people will be terrible , and in the u.s. , and china , between the poor and rich countries , and almost every life are much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for the question for which does i do it ?
we need to use more incentive we need to do for more .
if countries in the places of like eye , they should not talk about carbon .
you should learn these out , and you would n't require out of the normal press you have spent for these disorders .
we need to go out , we need co2 . it 's going to control the center that make something to make a trick .
we have to spread the message .
we need to make ourselves grow and we need to lead it and also the things that are being done by the government .
it 's an important wish , but what i think is we can do it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . it 's very much for a better thing , first , can you give us the idea of these resources ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a ship , to get all the big scientist that we do , we need just a few million , and even as we have a few million , and even if we have done our materials within a russian baby
the hard step is to find the first time to find another billion to the ones and the place in the place of the place .
and once the first finished is if it 's like this , it is all right , because the economy , the world 's way is so different than the economy we know about , how we know it .
to understand the way , this means deep in the ground .
bg : right . today , you have to go out the reactor 's new growth , so there 's a lot of people who are still , so many people , can go wrong , and many people can go wrong ,
but if you 've been very , very cheap news , you can think for 60 years -- think of an eye -- think about it .
and it goes over there and he killed 60 years for 60 years and then , then it 's done .
a psychologist , even a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . well , now , what happens on to the service of the lung , you can put it out -- there are a lot less waste with this method -- then take him to it , and keep it to the next slide .
and we start by looking by the waste that exist already has already exist in this eye or eye ; that 's our eye .
so , the thing for these numbers was a problem , which is what 's been in our lung and it 's the presence of a dramatic process , during this process .
but as you talked about different people in the world , over these possibilities have been talking to this point .
where is the world 's greatest interest , so what is really going ?
bg : now , we have n't put ourselves on a place and we have a lot of more interesting to everything that were in the name of the name , and there were big interest , and there were the people of the company in russia -- and
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and steel have done something in the direction .
this is an option one of it , which has done .
this is a critical step forward , but it 's like the faster reactor , and some of these countries have this built , so anyone who has a high reactor , with our first .
the idea is , do n't it work so anything really into your head ?
bg : now we need one of these eye systems , things which are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then we actually use it for 20 years .
this is like the incentive that we have for the show that we need to stop .
and , you know , you know if everything comes well , and this is a great wish that is going to keep it easy .
and luckily , today , today , dozens of companies , and we have hundreds of thousands of things that worked in the same way
and it would be best that if it gets multiple , you know , then you can use a resource .
we have certainly need a solution .
so in some of the big possible world , is this the largest thing you know ?
bg : a trick is the main test .
it would have been without the way it has been , but it even makes this much more important .
there is other very strong companies in the arab sector .
you know , we do n't know the work as well as these work , but there is the ideal one , that 's another approach .
there 's a ridiculous actor to be able to think that difficult , but maybe say that we have over us .
and so there 's different , but the nice thing is that there has a million times as much as a long time -- let 's say , let 's say , you know , when you can deal with the problems , and those costs
you know , if that works , what ?
do we need to figure out how to make try try to keep the world 's stable ?
bg : when you 're going to the situation , you can have too much as much you eat too much and a heart problem before , and what does you do ? you might have to do it ? you might
now , there 's a eye called the way that we have a different kind of techniques that is called in different techniques , so that we 're about 20 years to get in our 30 years .
that 's just a trick .
we hope we do n't need this .
some people say you do n't want to work on the insurance because that 's maybe one that does n't make any thing to eat so you eat , because you know that one could save your memories .
i do not know if it 's smart , if you take the importance that 's in front of you , but there 's a kind of a situation in the presence of whether you 've got to take it down , if you get it faster ,
climate change : did you have a number or two sentences for them to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , it 's got a lot of lots in a very different sphere .
those of those who do actually make this science situation , they 're very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that are doing with the clouds that are going on ?
there 's very , very few things that they can actually say that they have a chance in a million people .
this is a bit sort of thing that 's like right now , like aids .
you 're going to do right now , and you are not a lot later later .
and so the idea is , now when you 've been problems of all sorts of website -- to invest in something which has a clear -- and it comes out of the landscape is not necessarily a very first place , and there 's
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream is that when you could do it , at the same way , co2 , as well as an co2 , `` okay , i 'm not in fact that this did n't get co2 , but i probably want to accept
and that would be the answer in the order , the point that when you use it all time and energy to solve the co2 of the way , all other goals on malaria , which is there ,
bg : well , the real percentage of research , if we have the u.s. industry , we should spend 10 billion a year per year than it today -- this is not as dramatic .
it should n't suffer other things .
you get large in the front of you , and you can see , you can see , you can see a reasonable lot of people , if you 're not economic , you try to pay that -- for me , here 's the most food wave .
because , it is , you know , it 's very short in front of a eye , and he 's still even the learning things , and i think we 're going to try to be able to make the potential that the potential to be much less
if the interaction is , a lot of laughter is then only the rich eye can go .
i mean , every one of us here may have five times for five times on our energy without their lifestyle .
for the lower few billion per billion , it is a disaster .
and then , what happens is , well , what 's even a little bit around .
his new eye here is now : `` why is n't the science research anymore ? ''
he still will still , because of his previous stories , with the eye , but he has understood that this is a very rare group , and so that 's why it gets the game .
and that 's a bad thing i think i was in practice .
the research , the research , it is just crazy how little it will .
bill , i think i 'm talking to almost all people here if i say , i really hope that their wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , peter is saying a eye program called `` the eye . ''
the idea is pretty simple .
the trucks is to be on top of the wall .
and even though it 's really simple , it 's actually really hard because it 's people to get very quickly .
so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it in the eye .
it was a huge success .
since i did , i 've been done about 70 pounds in the world with students , business and architects , even with the interview , and there 's something that would allow you to the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them .
most people are going to go into the problem for the task .
you talk about it , you think about the way it 's going to look at is power .
then they invest in planning in planning and organization , and they went out , and they invest together .
they invest a lot of your time on the time all of the time used to make structures all the time .
and finally , just before you do n't have any time , you take the wall , and you name it on the top , a step back , `` you know , '' you do n't know your work .
but what 's going on , and then what happens to be a `` eye '' and that 's because the weight does n't matter the fuel that the whole one 's thing are going to be done and make up the whole thing .
there are a number of people who have a lot more `` the ones '' ''
you lie , you 're sitting , you 're confused and create confused and make it a really confused structure .
and of course , there are a lot more and much more things that have done with , and under the best ,
and this is quite amazing .
so , as peter did , they do n't just do the highest tree , but the most most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is : how do that be ? why ? what about that ?
and peter tells me , `` do n't tell the children in time left the middle of the center to be . ''
they do n't invest in the game .
but there 's another reason .
and in fact , that investors were in bosnia to find the real plan , ok , ok .
and so do know .
what happens if they do n't have the wall on the top , they have a time to have and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar what ?
and so what conservation workers do is they 're starting to build and build prototypes , successful prototypes still on the ground in the top , so they may have the ability to repair prototypes .
so , you know , you know that the kind of collaboration as a core of one eye ,
and with each other , they get up with the children wide feedback , which works , and they 're not going to .
so the power is working with prototypes , are worse , but let 's see how to look different about how different team stories .
the average is about the most eye , the average , coming on half of it , are going to get rid of its little , not a little bit more , but not a lot , biologists are better than adults .
who 's the most successful ?
architects and drugs , happiness .
the monkey is the best i saw .
and why ? because you 're understanding and understanding your own patterns , you 're building the keys to build stable structures .
it 's something about average , but it 's an interesting thing .
you have an act of curves on the team , you 're going to get some better .
it 's incredible . they see , and you see , `` this is what a team will do . ''
you can predict that . why is that ?
because you have special skills that have you .
she goes the process ; they understand .
and this team , which is what 's produced on the work and the performance of the team will be improve the performance of a team .
highly professional skills , and the combination lead to succeed .
if they 've got 10 teams , the typical ones are about , it gets out of six , which are in common structures .
so i tried to now fascinating .
i thought we bring the eye in the same way .
so i saw a $ 10,000 four of the software for the winner .
what do you think about this story ?
what was the result ?
this is not a team had a robust structure .
if you had someone high , he had to get the price back home .
so is it really interesting is that it 's a powerful effect of a powerful effect ?
we owe this exercise with these same students .
what do you think happened ?
now , she did n't understand the advantage of `` the advantage . ''
so , in fact , in the same , no team in the best of one .
it 's produced the highest pattern in the same time .
so , there 's lessons that we 've been trying to do for ourselves , about the nature of a nest and success of success .
you might ask , why would somebody like to create a interview with you ?
the reason is , i get digital tools to help and help a team of helping cars and video games , and `` do . ''
and what is the trick is to identify them from all the way to identify them .
because the open thing said , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is going to have a common experience , a common language for you to build that right right .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of practice .
and those who are really interested in , can go ahead .
and it 's a blog where you see how you build the nuclear budget .
there 's a trick there .
you find crazy examples from the world , like people that have done the system and make the system .
there are also the ones that go there .
and the point is , i think , the world is actually a game in a place .
it requires that we 're all in all of our senses to be able to use our sense , and we use our thinking more than our feelings and our doing , in the challenge that we 're doing .
and sometimes an smaller prototype of this experience of what it takes to take us from one to `` eye '' .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we 're like here , here , a machine .
a big machine , like a kind of cool machine -- and this is a light machine .
and everybody in this room have to go in this space .
and you can go into the past , you can walk into your future ; you ca n't stay on here and now .
and i wonder what they choose because i 've had asked my friends in the last time , and they all go out to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to back back to the time before cars were , or twitter or ] , america is looking at the roof .
i do n't know .
and i believe that you like to draw a way of thinking of thinking of being a way of thinking of thinking .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of that group , i have to say .
i do n't want to , and that 's not because i 'm a trigger .
it 's because it 's not going to go on the planet , they 're going ahead .
so , i want to go into that machine , and i will go into the future .
this is the real time there was the most planet on the planet , whether all they do is health , is health , rich , health ,
there 's never been for a time of a time like this before .
i 've got all the stick when they were about 60 people .
my grandparents was that number to 70 .
so my parents are the 80 on the hospital .
so , then we should have a nine of the start of my eye .
but it 's not even people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a child , i think , is a child that was born in new york , which is a lot of the world in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox , smallpox have killed billion people on this planet .
they have a way of trying to take a way in the way that there are no war for them .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have it . bye .
so , in the rich world there are all diseases of what there are millions of us , there were only a generation under a generation , not yet .
there 's the game force , smoke ...
now , you even know what that is ?
vaccines with common medicine , the modern medicine is our ability to feed billions of people , that are success of the science 's method .
and from from my point , the scientific way to do is doing things , look at whether it works , it does change if it does n't do , one of the most great logic of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's all the whole good news because there 's some other problems , and it was often a lot .
and one of them is that , despite all , there are a billion more people in the world , hungry , hungry .
this number goes up , and it gets very fast , and that 's a paper .
and not only , we used our ability to be used a lot more time in order to live .
the water , the country , rainforests , oil , gas : they 're going , and if we do n't go out of that chaos , we 're going to disappear .
so the question is : could we do that ? i guess it 's .
i think it 's obvious to that we can feed food , the billions of people are eating without the land that they live on .
i think we can not power with this world with energy that they did .
i really believe that , and no , that 's not a thought of thinking .
but this goes up with me , and one of the things that hold up me in night , and we 've never never really quite strong progress as well as now as now .
and we also have never that we 've never been able to see it in the way that we can do it today .
we are on the door to too hot in a way with a lot of many areas , and yet i really think we would have to go up hundreds , 300 years ago ,
the people kept in their mind , and that 's so hard that you ca n't be free .
it 's not even the truth it 's going to be free .
and listen to everybody , everyone has a simple thing on his opinion ; even a way to do with the progress for your opinion .
but do you know where you do not have right ?
they do n't have right on their own facts . they do n't have them .
and i needed a little time to try to find that .
about a hundred a month ago , i wrote an article for the new yorker , a little paper .
and i was amazed to get down to the resistance on what most most effective activity is in health history in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what i should do was , so i was just doing what i always do , i wrote the article , and he did .
and soon i was going to be changed an article on some article .
same thing that 's going to get bigger .
people were nuts .
so , i wrote a article and i wrote it , and i could n't understand why you thought molecules that molecules on a particular one of the area of nature has been looking at the field of nature .
but you know what i do doing . i wrote the article , i went back .
i mean i am a journalist , right ?
we type we 're going to go rich , we eat , that is okay .
but the articles kept worried about it , and i could n't figure figure why , and eventually , i found it .
and that 's because the game that were crazy did n't get the trick at all .
these were 700 people , young people , including people .
they were just like people around this room .
and that brought me to this stuff ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we 're able to be able to think about the point where we do n't have the same relationship in progress like earlier .
we 're talking about that .
we 're going to talk about more than small weapons to do : `` progress . ''
okay , so there 's a reason why , and i think we know what 's more reasons .
we have trouble in institutions , in trouble , and sometimes we lost the science science , and there is no reason why that should n't be this way .
you can just do some names , you can see the people .
it 's done with that , you can see , you see , mass mass mass people in 2000 .
i mean , you know you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we believed that they were going to have right forever . so be common .
ask questions , for example , demand evidence to you .
do n't take any given any than a given .
but now , if you get to take the evidence , you assume this evidence , and that 's not what we 're doing .
and i can say that in an epidemic now , we 've never seen them yet , hopefully i 'll never see hope .
about 12 years ago , a story published a horrible story , which
very scary .
our studies have been done to see if that was true .
now , there should be a serious studies ; this is a serious issue .
data came in place .
the data came out of the united states -- from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all in the same .
it does n't matter . it does n't make any difference because we think about what we 're seeing , what we see in , what does think we feel really , we feel really .
we do n't think of a bunch of documents that we do with a while of a eye that is data , and i understand that , i think we all are .
but do you know what ?
and the result of that was white .
and so , i think so , some of the fact that the u.s. was one of the single countries in the earth , in which the power force is attached to reach down the world .
this is a massive and we should be ashamed .
it 's bad .
what 's happening is , what we could do about this .
well , i understand it . i do .
because here 's what anybody agreed ?
has a single one in the audience ever die in the one ever die ?
it does n't happen quite very often .
in this country , you know , not in this country , but today , in the last year , over the last year .
that 's a lot of death coming through , 20 times an hour .
but because this is n't here , we can get it out of this , and people like japanese may take around , or the cause of fear and the lack of management lives live in live live , live king .
and that may make you know because they do n't get the cause and to connect them away .
you do n't understand these things seem to be as well but almost never be the same .
and this is something we have to learn to learn and very quickly .
this is a hero , it was in it , in , in , with this guy .
he puts us one with one of the most of humanity in humanity .
no fear , no male , plastic , apart , is gone apart .
the guy in the middle was n't very much .
he is called paul fiction .
he 's developed with a few different people developed it .
it can save the lives of the game , including a year per year in the developing world .
pretty good , do n't ?
now , that 's good enough , besides the world 's good business , and you talk , `` how are you going to be valuable , and that people should be able to fall . ''
and that 's what he said .
paul is a turning place .
if paul talks in a public weapon , he can not tell me any famous point .
he gets calls to home , because people would love to tell him where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a condom .
i do n't say that ; i need to share them in terms of issues .
you take them to go back back , terrible diseases , and that 's happening .
we 're getting here in this country .
and that 's worse , and quite soon kids will die from it , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they will not just die .
what happened with genomics ? let 's take this . why not ?
so one trick from me i wrote a few weeks ago , and i think that i am a little bit to buy a little bit .
nobody has ever said before .
she would not keep her child against facebook . in no case .
bets .
why ? because we do n't have any seed . and you know what ?
we did n't have a bike yesterday yesterday in that country .
today , i 'm not know , perhaps i 've got a little bit at my house tomorrow , and we just get on los angeles right now , right now over time .
and in a few hours , he 's going to get out and make a car , and he 's coming to long beach , and he 'll go on one of the eye in the evening .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a synthetic disease , and we do n't realize it because the world is now once .
this is the planet we live in . do n't like it , as he did n't .
we love to go on lying . we love that .
do you all taken your computer tomorrow tomorrow ?
so there 's a little business that helps them help to do that .
i know you 've made that made that because half of americans make it every day .
they take the stuff , and they say , they 're taking an alternative , and it does n't make any difference in how often we tend to figure out that they are not resilient .
the data is constantly constantly .
they make their own , and they 're almost almost .
so okay , you 'd like to pay the billion billion dollars in the dark people .
i 'll tell you completely .
dark , dark .
why do we make that ? why do we do this ?
now , i think i understand -- it hate the main industry hate .
we hate one to make strong government . we have no trust .
and we should n't do that . our health system is covered .
it 's really cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold , and it 's just amazing to itself who can afford to afford it .
so we 're going away , and where are we doing ?
we 're going to walk into the arms of the eye .
this is amazing . i love the game .
but , you know , this is really serious about this , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of mysteries here there .
none of those -- do you have to go there , it 's done with , but i do n't even know what that is : but we spend billions of dollars for it , it 's done .
and you know what ? if i say that , people ' and say to me , `` what are you going ? people do ? what they want . what they want . ''
they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it really is n't my case , whether it 's the editor who says , `` hmm , i 'm going to take the evidence of my resources , '' or some people who will be able to do to treat his patients with the game .
if you 're going on in this path , and the magic of the gps effects and science replace science is going to a place they 're going to want to be .
they get to use to meet power in south africa .
he brought away and he brought away because he was there that red software is , right there and actually the much more more effective and much more effective drugs , which we know that they can be able to fill out the way of aids .
and hundreds of thousands of calculations of death in a country that will be put any other from that disease .
do n't tell me that these things are no consequences .
they have . they 're always having them .
now , the voices that we 're just right now is this exponential struggle between the presence of the presence of food and the game .
that 's a crime debate . it 's got to stop .
it 's a debate of words , about metaphors .
this is a ideology of ideology , not science .
all right , so we 're eating , each time , we 're going to be able to go to each water , every silk being changed from the people .
you know , there were no eye in the garden .
there was no way there .
there were no staff . we did all of this .
we 've done it in the last hundred years .
and some of it has worked , and some does n't work .
we are what they did n't work .
now we can do it , and obviously risks , but we can do anything like vitamin a a , and it can help millions of people , millions of people , tens of their own life .
do n't you want to do this ?
i have to say , that 's not what i understand .
we have changed to be changed food .
so why do we do this ?
now , what i 'm going to hear is , too high chemicals , invest , comfort , you want to get a big fields with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to keep companies living in life .
we do n't like to have companies to get seeds .
and you know how my response is to all of this ?
yes , they are right . we do .
it 's true , we have a huge trick , but that 's not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it 's right to morality , with you .
you know , science is not a company .
it is n't a country .
she 's not one idea ; you can be a process .
she 's a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes do n't work , but the idea that we have to allow science is not to do the work because we 're in the
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll need 70 percent plants than it is in moment . 70 percent .
these are the investment electrodes in africa over the last 30 years in africa .
wear . bye .
you have to have this , and we do n't give them .
and why ? does it be food .
we want to encourage people to eat this knowledge like that , for example .
there 's something half a billion people .
it 's something like like a brand .
it 's just a handful of water , it 's in front of it .
it did n't have to have any of those it does n't have a protein , and scientists create all of this to happen in it .
and then they could eat , and they would n't be blind .
you would n't be hungry , and you know what ?
that 's nice . it 's not going to go it up , but it 's beautiful .
and all i 'm able to say is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , ask we ask , why are we fighting this ?
because we ca n't want us to want genes ?
it 's not the genes of the genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it is n't about our attitude for comfort , which means that we depend on bigger food , better food , smaller food , low food .
it 's not about teenagers , it 's about to get people alive , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if you do n't do it , if we 're going to do like we do so far , what we do is we think about something that we think we 're not going to
there is no other description for what this happens happening here .
it 's central , it 's general ; it is our matter , and then we need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , `` you still want to go in this news machine and go into your future ? ''
anyway . that 's why i 'd like to .
now , in the present right , it 's in the present , but you have an amazing opportunity .
we can put these light on all what we want .
we can get them in our lives where we want to be in charge , and we 'll get them up there , where we want .
we have to make that conversation , and we need to think , but if we go into the movies and go into the future , we 'll be lucky to be done .
i know we could , and as far as i can , what we need to do is something that 's going to take now .
thank you .
thank you .
i have been thinking i 've been thinking about the eye for a time , which is that a magician in that would be interested in fact that , you know , look like this , as i like , ``
with other words in some studies , you have a legal effect , you know , that person 's going to be because the person thinks what 's happening , is to be a sense of ...
it 's a deception is going to be true , because somebody 's learning .
so one of the things that we also understand is , i want to show you a pattern , very simple to the magic .
and i 'm going to show you how it works , this is a trick that has been in least at least in the 1950s since the children .
i myself , i 've been learned him with him . i learned it in the 1970s in the 1970s .
i will go for them and explain to him .
and then i 'll tell you why i 'm going to tell him .
so , look what happens .
the knife you 've seen , my hand , that you can study .
i 'll just hold the slides in my face .
i was back to the surprise .
and so to ensure that there 's nothing in my surprise , or out of it , i 'm just going to be able to look at my tongue right here .
you can see that way , you see , you can see time . as long as i do here , there ca n't be done in my surprise or out there .
and the goal is pretty simple .
i will open my hand , hopefully if everything else is going to be good through my body 's good physical .
it 's actually so finding his place that i can shake it , without getting a knife .
nothing that goes on to my surprise or is not a deal . and they can look at everything .
marcus !
now , that is a trick that i 'm much young kids who care for climate change , because you can learn a lot about deception when you do a little bit of deception when it 's a very simple trick .
probably many of you know , here in the room that it is a trick .
and he 's got the idea .
i 'm going to hold down the knife in my hand .
i say that i 've got my ear to make sure , make sure nothing 's going on in my pocket or more , and this is a lie .
the reason i 'm doing is that i 've got my blog , it 's that there is the real secret in the illusion .
and in the moment , where i take my hand out of you , so you 're moving away from you , you know , this guy here , my accident just simply , where it was , in a position that he 's so rare .
amazing trick ?
and then , someone is sitting on the back of the back there , who was not a little childhood .
so he 's here . right .
and if i go to you , the finger changes its position .
and now we could talk about why that is natural , which you do n't really realize that there we 're going down at the bottom here , because the mind and the way that he 's talking about information , you do n't have a , one ,
now that 's not going here , actually , i open my hand .
of course , it gets down there , of course , not through the fall of my body , but through a trick that is there .
and if i leave my hand , this is what i 'd like to do , using me a movement , that 's the movement that the fingers were doing again .
i 'm going away . and here 's the knife .
you can see that you know your friends ' friends and talk . thank you .
now , what has this done to do with ?
a year ago , a study i read really study to me and really miss me .
i 'm not not a doctor or researchers , so that was an amazing thing for me .
and this is what if you put in the form of a white pill , in the shape of a eye , so that 's just simply going to be one and the white pill that 's going on
but if you 're changing the way you change this , for instance , into a smaller paper , and this blue internet change and a letter for it , it 's actually illegal relationships .
and so , although none of these things , they are just about it .
but a white pill 's not as well as blue in blue water .
what ? let me get that really made me .
and it turns out it 's not all that it 's not all about that .
if you take out , you are still more more and more more and more more more than any shape of each form .
it 's a number like the end of the end in one end in a end of the yellow yellow , and the other red , has better than you have one white translation .
the safety is playing a role .
a night twice twice as well as three kilometers -- i ca n't remember that completely to the most three . i am sorry .
but the key thing is ...
-- in fact that , you know , you 're kind of play with a role .
and the shape is playing .
and if you want to have the ultimate eye , you have to be able to get off the needle .
right ? so a gene , with a trick -- a bunch of the eye in a eye , which , you put in the patient 's patients , you know , so you know , you know .
this creates a very powerful picture in head . that 's a lot harder than a nuclear pill .
so this chart , really , really -- i 'm going to show you one another time when we got an secret .
so the fact is that the white water does n't seem to work as well as the blue pill that does n't seem as well as well as a soldier that works as well as the child .
and none of it , it has any really sophisticated property , it 's just our belief in us to make a greater impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a heart magic .
i 'm going to take you something that is obviously a deception , which is what it looks like .
we know from this study to be able to go through the needle when it 's going to go to this thing .
so this is one 18 an long time -- she is very , very different , and i 'll watch her a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my meat , because it 's not the very specific core visual meat .
this one is my skin ; this is not a special element of hollywood .
i 'm going to go through the needle into my skin and go through it , until we turn up on the other hand .
if you get more bad -- if you 're easy to fall -- and i 've taken some friends in the hotel building in the hotel , and some people that i do n't know and there has become a woman almost extinct .
so i 'm going to suggest if you get it all , and look at the next 30 seconds away . or , you know , i will do the first run back here .
you can see it in the same , but you might also have if you want to .
so it 's kind of like this in here , and where i start to do the meat of my mind , i 'm going to get a small part of my mind .
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry . does it go crazy ?
and now just a little bit about my skin and on the other side , so again .
now we 're actually in the same situation we had with the eye .
it 's about it .
but now you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'll show you . this is one , two and two , three , five .
you know .
i know the people who think if you 're seeing that .
they say , `` okay , well , this is certainly not that stupid , and it 's the spread to himself , just to get us for us to get a couple minutes . ''
well , then i 'll show you .
what does it look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people go back and said , `` okay . i 've never seen this right . ''
people in the eye now are coming in .
so let me show you close .
this is really my skin , and this is not a special element from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can have the glue .
sorry . if you get it , look away , look at it , you do n't look at it .
the people back to the back and the time that once later on video and you say , `` well , i guess that 's quite familiar , and if it was , he would be , '' he would -- you have a hole , and there 's
okay , so let me get a little couple of blood for you .
yes , it 's .
usually , i would usually see the needle on the needle .
i would love to the poor center , and show you there is n't a democratic ring .
but i think that in this context , there with an natural intent , i 'm going to make some of the needle inside there , i 'm going to go inside and you can walk from the stage .
we 're going to face it in the next few time .
so i hope you 're looking about it . thank you .
everybody 's talking about happiness now .
i have a couple of people most of the number of books , which is called `` eye '' published on the last five years , and they gave them for something like 40 , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave to tell you to happiness , you know .
there are a lot of laughter that you 're doing .
everybody would like to be happier .
but despite all of these documents of working , there are several cognitive notes that almost allowed to be able to think of happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive fall .
so this is true about your own happiness , which is , for scientists , they think about happiness , because they are the same thing as any one is like everyone else .
the first of these fall is a game that 's going to express complexity .
it turns out the word is n't a useful word anymore because we 're going to apply to many other things .
i think there might be a certain meaning that we can tell it , but in the large and everything that 's something we need to be going to be in , and we 'll imagine the complicated perspective to what 's well-being .
the second thing is a very beautiful experience and experience and memory , but basically , in his life , in his life and happy his life , or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ways of concepts , and you 're both in the idea of lucky .
and the third thing is the eye , and this is the broken fact that we can never think about the fact of the well-being without the importance of it .
i mean , this is a real prediction .
and there 's just no way to get it out .
now i like to start with a example of somebody who had a interview for one of my favorite phone , who was sort of taken a story -- [ unclear ] ... ] he said , he would have
and then it 's going to turn , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , that was the whole experience of the whole experience .
but it did n't really .
what it was n't that it had the memory to experience in the experience of experience .
he had had the experience .
he had 20 minutes to music .
they do n't notice because he was with a memory ; the memory was n't ; and it was all who he had .
what really really says is that we 're thinking about other people in terms of two kinds of self .
there 's a trick trick that 's living in the present and the time , you know , the past is going to experience the past , but just the present is just the present .
it 's the trick itself , you know , when the doctor says , `` do n't we hurt the doctor , if i hurt you ? ''
and then there 's one eye self , and the trick itself is it , which is , and the point is that you have , and the story of all of our life , and it is the one of our life by saying the doctor 's
or `` how did their journey be more high ? '' or so that 's the way .
these are two very different units of themselves , which are at the face of themselves , and the eye themselves , and the two of them , is part that 's part of the cortex of the happiness .
well , this is a magician itself now .
and that 's really beginning to begin with a fundamental response to our memory -- it starts on .
we do n't tell stories when we do stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we need to hold on our education is a history .
and let 's try with one example .
there 's an old study .
these are real patients coming to a powerful crisis .
i 'm going to go in detail . it 's not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done .
they were asked to report out all the 60 seconds of pain .
and here are two patients . that 's your records .
and they 're asked , `` who 's the one from both have suffered the way ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
patient b is clear more more , and the trick was longer , and then every minute from pain , who a patient had an patient b , and more .
but now , there 's another question : `` how much thought these patients did that that they make up ? ''
and here 's a surprise surprise .
and the surprise is that patient has a lot of people who had the patient 's disease .
the stories that was different , and because it 's a big part of the story , as it ends up .
and no one of those stories is very helpful or great -- but one of them is very clearly ...
but one of them 's more than the other .
and the people who is worse was where the pain was really in the end of his peak , it 's a bad story .
how do we know it ?
because what we asked asked people asked people asked , and much later , `` how 's the whole thing was the whole thing ? ''
and it was a lot worse for the interaction to b b .
now , this is a real conflict between itself between itself and the trick .
from a view of self , he had really clearly an eye time .
now , what 's going to do with your patient , and we actually have done clinical schools experiments , and it 's made , and this is what it 's working , and you could actually do the presence of the patient a lot of
this will lead the patient to be a little bit , and much less than before .
and if you do it for a few minutes , you make that there 's a bad one , you have a bad one , and you think that the game itself will be much better , because there is a better story about his experience .
what is a story about ?
and the stories for the stories that makes memory , and it 's also for the stories that we invent .
and also , a story is the u.s. states , some moments and end .
and finally end are very , very important and in this case , that 's what we end up .
well , that the game itself live with itself .
it has moments of the eye , one one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the response is , really . you 're always lost .
i mean , the most moments of our life -- and i think that life -- you know , psychological present as about three seconds , which means , what means is , you know , in a lifetime of life in a life ,
most of them are completely ignored by the game themselves .
and yet , you sort of get you the idea that you should count that what the moments of the eye is happening our life .
it 's kind of cool resource that we use as we are in this planet .
and as we 're able to use it , it 's not the history of itself , to keep us to us .
so we have the right self and itself , and they are really very different .
the biggest difference between you is time .
from the eye itself , when you have a shepherd , and the second week is exactly like the first last week , and then you can take twice as well as good as well .
that 's not how it does n't work .
now , to itself , a trick is really able to do some better than your time , because there are no new memory .
you have n't changed the story .
in fact , in fact , in fact , actually , in fact , actually , really , critical features , that a trick itself itself is different from a trick . period time , it has very little influence in that story .
well , that gives you a lot more than you to do and tell stories .
it 's actually a number of the decisions for decisions , because if you have a patient , which is , we 're going to say two of you two different surgeons , and if you 're going to choose , what you 're willing to vote , the
the trick is not going to have a voice in that choice .
we actually do n't choose between education science , we choose to get between memory to experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we do n't normally do our future .
we think about our future in the end of memory .
and basically , you can see that , you know , as an example of the eye itself , and you can think of yourself than one that is , that is , you know , that 's the time that is
i feel that if we 're going on , we do very often in the case of this , we 're going to do them in services in the services itself .
and that 's a little bit hard , i think .
i mean , how much do we do about our memory ?
that 's one of the prediction theory that 's given for the edges of the game itself .
and when i think about that , i think about it a few years ago in a couple of years ago that i 'd ever been , and i think relatively often in the relationship to talk about other times
and i 've probably run my memories from my memories of this eye , i would say about 25 minutes , in the previous four years .
now , if i ever had open the finger open with the most remote pictures of this , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , that 's what they 're about a year .
there seems to be a magic analogy .
now , i like a little bit very , very , you know , in this way i have a little , but you know , when you have a real memories of memory , but even if you make more of them , there 's a real question
so i want you to think about this thought .
imagine a little bow , you know that the end of these will be taken all the images , and you get into a online drug so that they 're not going to be able to be able to remember anything .
well , if you could choose the same sheet of what ?
and if you 'd choose to choose one of them , there 's a conflict between the two species of self , and you have to believe about how they decide these conflict , and it 's really not obvious , because if you get a answer ,
why we use the product that we think is a problem which we think about choice of the same types of self .
well , both kinds of self would have two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we ca n't care , one one in a even self .
so you can ask , how is the trick itself is ?
and then they would ask you , `` how happy are the time in life at life ?
and they 're all about happiness for decades to have a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions of that are dinosaurs can become ?
and , by the way , we 're now saving a very good idea about happiness of itself .
if you ask the happiness itself , you have a very different thing .
that 's not what 's happy : it 's a person who lives .
it 's like curiosity , or it 's a person 's person when they think about their lives .
very different term .
anybody who made these words not to make sense of happiness and i 'm looking at a lot of researchers about well-being , who have been done in the same long long time in exactly exactly this way .
so the distinction between the puzzle itself itself and the happiness of the mind itself are found in the last few years and now , and now we try to measure both the two guys .
the presence of energy has a global global survey at more than one more than a million people who have had a million people who think about what they think about their life and about their experience , and there 's other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the self to learn .
and the key lesson we think is that they are really different .
you can know how to be your life in your life , and that 's really really what really did n't teach me a lot about how happy he lives is living and other times .
just to get a sense of work , the temperature has a way to do with it .
what is that means to do that , if you 're going to meet someone , you would say , oh , his father is a trick , what do you know it about his size ?
now , you would know there about his size , but there are a lot of uncertainty .
they have so uncertainty .
if i told you that someone 's life on a scale , they 've a lot of a lot of them about how happy he is with the most eye self .
so the temperature industry is low .
so , we know something about what is the happiness of the game .
we know that money is very important , goals is very important .
we know that happiness is mostly really being willing to spend with people who we like to do time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but it 's a problem .
so , when you 're lucky to these kinds of self , they 're going to do it at the end of the very different things .
the evidence of what i said here is that we 're really not going to be able to imagine than a 3d tool for well-being .
it 's a completely different thing .
now , a short reason , which we do n't realize about very lucky , we do n't think that we do n't care about the same things of the same thing we want to think about life , and when we actually live lives .
so if you ask the easy question , how happy people in the california are , they 're not going to get the right answer .
if you think that question ? people have to be in california , if you say , we say , in groups .
and what happens is that when you think about life in egypt , think about the difference between california or other places , and this difference is , you say , in the climate .
well it turns out that the climate is not really important for the end itself , and it 's not really important for the collective itself to be able to be people .
but now , because the creation itself is responsible , you can end at the end -- some people could go out to california .
and it 's very interesting to follow whatever happens with people who are going to get to california .
now you 're not going to be happier at yourself .
we know this .
but one thing is happening . you will think what you 're happier , because when you 've been thinking about it , you 're going to be in the weather , and you feel that you 've made the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think of thinking about well-being , and i hope i 'm a sense of a sense of how difficult it .
thank you .
thank you , thank you have a question .
thank you .
so when we 're doing a few more weeks ago , they 've started to talk about me that it gave me quite interesting , which was out of that with those eye .
is this something that they can make us feel about , because you 've left a few minutes left left here ?
daniel elephant : sure .
i think the exact thing that we found in the presence is a number that we absolutely has n't been expected to find .
and we found that that in terms of happiness itself in terms of itself .
when we looked at how emotions we saw the income .
and it turns out that under income dollars 60,000 dollars 60,000 to americans , and this is a really large example of american americans , about 100 degrees , but it 's a great
60,000 .
tr : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they 're getting more increasingly , they will be getting rid of them .
and we 're getting a absolutely flat line about it .
i mean , i 've seen that way like that .
what happens is obviously , money does n't put a trick , but lack of the money , certainly one means , is very clear , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , you get another story .
the longer money you made is the child is .
it 's not true for emotions .
but smoke , in the whole american interaction , it 's about life , freedom to the sound of happiness .
if people were to take this thing seriously , i mean , it seems to be all the way that we believe for example , for instance , in terms of data and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is going to take seriously like seriously would they make care of their policy .
tr : you know , i believe there is the most dangerous part of the eye in politics .
so the higgs is that is going to be very slow in the united states , and no question , but in america , it 's happening right now , and in other countries , it 's happening right now .
people are in the ability to think about happiness when they think about politics .
it 's going to be a while and the people will argue whether they want to explore the eye or whether you want to be able to focus on , so we need to take that discussion quite soon .
as you get lucky , it 's very different to the way you think , and whether you think about yourself with yourself , you might think about yourself or to yourself with the game themselves .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you 're going to be able to measure the game of the population .
so that 's me , i think , in the nearest one or two americans , it 's part of the national statistics .
now , i think it looks like i 'm going to , or at least the most interesting political debate , over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of climate change .
thank you , tony elephant all .
i 'm a psychologist i 'm a journalist . i was doing video games .
i 'm living for 10 years now . and my goal is for the next decade of saving it in reality , to save the world in the reality .
i 've got a plan for it . i want to convince more people who do n't have all time to play with play and play games .
at this point , we spend three billion hours per week .
and some of you may think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
maybe much time in case you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , in my research at the '60s , for the future is exactly the opposite of an opposite .
three billion hours of hours of hours of hours a week , they do n't even have any other enough to get to solve the game problems to solve the world .
in fact , i realized that when we want to survive the nearest century to survive on the planet , to increase it in each time .
i have argue that took time in the 21 billion hours a year a week .
so , you know , perhaps first , i 'll get it out about this , and if we 're going to solve problems like hunger , global warming and global school and obesity , i think we 'll try and play games online online hours a week
no , i really want to be serious .
why ? this image is pretty much exactly why i do believe that games are so critical for survival of human species . seriously .
so this is actually a symbol of the day that i can do .
he wanted to be able to play at play . so he 's built a camera in front of the game .
so this is one of the classic figures that play . play .
if you 're not an player , maybe some of you may use the bubble in this picture .
you can see that sense of urgency , things like that . you see something like fear , but also , you know , basic , basic quality , bodies , in the context of a really difficult problem .
you play yourself , you see some of you out here , which up to the top you 're going on , and you 're married , you 're an sign of optimism , the gender ethic show .
this is a player who is on the verge of a call of a call of a call .
oh , you know this . thank you . so we have a little player here .
a result is a result , so it is very different that you do n't know that there was actually possible before .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if they do it , they are shocked that they 're actually able to do something like this . it 's a result of scale .
and this players , in short , in a particular short , at least as a quick record .
and this is what we have to see across millions of parts of scale on the world , if we take the fact of the next century , the face of the world , the face of all , they are on the edge of all
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life , when we face so hard to know .
i call it that as `` in my life , '' i am bad . '' and it is actually my face , and it 's what i see ? yes ? ok .
that 's what i 'm `` in life , '' i am fine . ''
this is an appointment mechanism in my former school in tanzania , california , where i knew in my business was a better better than a real life .
that 's a problem that many players have .
we think that in reality , we 're not so good like play .
and i 'm not just successful in any successful , even though it 's the case .
we 're getting more . i mean , i mean , i 'm doing the way with the motivation , to do something , inspired to work with collaboration .
if we are in an eye , i think a lot of us will take into our best architects , any time , we 're immediately sure to solve the problem , so long as long as they do it , you know .
and reality , if we take failure , when we 're driving it up , we really do n't feel ourselves differently .
we feel deep . we feel it . we feel it all of depressed , property , property , property .
we never do n't think if we play play in play in play , they simply just ca n't .
and that 's what i wanted to do as a student student .
why is it impossible to think , in play , you could n't get anything done everything ?
how can we make these emotions out of play in reality ?
so i looked like world of warcraft , which is what the most ideal environment is the global environment .
and i 've seen some things that i 've seen the ordinary way in the way that you can do that .
so , first of all , if you get in one of these eyes , especially in the world of india , there is a lot of different characters who are willing to go to you with you a trick mission , right now .
but not only is a mission , it 's a mission , a mission to its current level in the game , really ?
so , let 's make that .
you have never got a task you can not solve you .
but always on the edge of their ability , so you have to make sure . but there are no unemployment in world of populations .
you 're n't sitting around and it 's in the morning . there 's always a whole thing to do there .
and there are tens of thousands of people .
and you go out , you go from hundreds of people who work with them to end their pictures mission .
we do n't live in the real lives in the real life , this feeling of people , that there is a eye of the people who are willing to stand in .
and also there is this sort of a story , that kind of fun story , why we are there , and what we have to do .
and then , we can get this positive feedback .
you 've got to have it up by `` level , '' and `` holy strength '' -- that 's `` extra intelligence . ''
this is not a pair of feedback that there are n't in the actual feedback .
if i leave this stage , i do n't have , you know , i have to speak , you know , i have a disease idea , i do n't have a extra idea ; i 've got to do a crazy idea .
i 'm not going to get on the real life of this experiments .
so , the problem of the eye is how world of warcraft is that it is so inspired to be able to stand out on the edge of a poor `` individual '' and that we 're going to spend our whole time .
they 're just a better than reality .
so far , all the world has been spent together for the million million years today that they 've spent virtual problems from the way .
that is n't necessarily something bad .
it sounds like bad .
but to see it in the context of this , millions of years , our first years started to keep our first step online .
so the first bottle of his first papers .
ok , so if you 're going to talk , how much years we spend with play right now , and it makes sense that when you 're in terms of the time you 're in the scale of human development , you know , which is powerful .
but also , right ? because it turns out to play that whole time , in fact , that we 're really changing to do something that we 're capable of being able to do .
we 're going to be used to a variety , so we develop ourselves .
this is the most true truth . i think it is .
once you have a interesting interesting statistics , that recently published from a researchers who was published by the former age , `` the average young man , from a strong phone , 10,000 hours of being 10,000 hours to the 21 to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours of hours is an incredibly interesting number of reasons that 's second .
first of all , for children in the united states , they are right now that they spend in school , who spend them in school , from the five grade grade to high school -- if you never missing .
so here we have a complete eye now , on the young people , to learn what 's means to be a good player like anything that you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of bertie web , `` look at '' '' read .
so she knows his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours ,
it 's based in the great research who if we spend 10,000 hours to put into the image of a given world 's 21 to the 21st to the 21st of time , 2011 , we 're going to come up with it in it .
we 're going to become good about what the most common people in the world are .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young human beings who are now .
so the big question is , `` what 's a real player 's invisible ? ''
because if we could find that out , we would have never been able to use a result of all the potential there .
so many people have been in the world that spend at least an hour a day ,
these are our eye with this : 500 million people who are incredibly good into `` something . ''
and then the next decade we have a more like another player that are extraordinary good at which they 're still forever .
you do n't heard it before .
the games rate are designed to save energy and working on the power , instead of working with the eye so , that players can play in the world , especially in india -- in india , brazil .
you 're going to be expected to be an extra billion player in the next decade .
we have an billion player in this .
so i started to think about what it is to make these play games .
here are four things that i found , first of them .
ok , imagine how the product are coming .
so , this is what to do , to do , something to do , to get a message with the faith that we 've had a thin hope on success .
players are always believe about that there 's a while you can be , and it 's being more chance to try and be in the same .
there are no player in your own .
so players are skin images in the open of social nets .
there 's a lot of interesting research that 's showing us that we have more like that , after we played them with them , even when they have us safe .
the reason for this is that it needed a lot of trust to play with anybody to play a game .
we trust that people spend time with the rules that we have the same goal and stay up with the road up in the road .
so the way that is going to keep the way that i can grow up the way you can grow up the way you 're growing up to work , and trust each other .
we build more social social relationships , as well .
all of productivity . amazing !
you see , there is a reason why there are five hours a game of a week , sort of a week , in the end of the end of the way that you are doing with it .
the reason is that when we play , we actually are happier about , we know , we actually work hard to work as if we fail or do something .
we know we 're responsible than human beings , when we make hard , amazing work .
and the players are always ready for , hard to work , when they get the right task .
and finally , the things were the importance .
so players are going to love it to be a little bit part of the order to get a result of the eye .
here , the eye to go on to the right , you know , all of wikipedia , the world 's largest going to the world .
the second thing to the world is about nearly smooth , is the world of warcraft 's beach .
five million people are using it every month .
they have more information on earth 's internet in the internet , as much different than any other issue in every other of the world .
they create a remote story , right ?
they 're creating a remote source of the knowledge of the world of warcraft .
so , ok , so that 's four to one you lead to you one outcome .
it 's people who believe that they can change the world as well .
and the only issue is they believe you 're going to change the virtual language , but not the real military worlds .
that 's the problem that i 'm trying to solve .
now , we have the idea of what we call is a trick .
his job is great . he study why people spend so much time , energy and money .
and they say , `` well , we 'll not be less less than one can be less than any eye in virtual worlds , and it 's . ''
and that 's an economist like that , so it 's sense like it . ''
and he says ...
it 's not like me -- i 'm probably thinking about it , i 'm a trick .
so he says , really meaning , because the players are , can reach more into the actual life .
they can be used in play social leone than in real life . and they get more feedback and reward in games like real life .
so he says , `` it 's really the way that no players spend in the virtual world than the real world .
i 'm just going to say to thank you a voice . it does n't sense of voice .
but it does n't definitely get any time .
we need to begin to make the real world in a game .
my inspiration is coming from an event , 100 years ago .
there 's these square years , which is , out there , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
so this fantastic game was there , there were a game of this fantastic game .
and so these were the first of people that we 've been developed to share .
and if you 're going to be familiar with the old greek of the old people who are familiar with , you may know that story . the story of it , like and why games have invented .
you 're going to get games to play , and you 're going to see , in the kingdom , there was invented during a famine .
now , you know , we 've got such a great lot of time the king of the eye is going to an crazy idea to an crazy idea .
people are doing it down . people fail .
it was a brilliant situation . you needed a brilliant solution .
so , according to you , ted is going to go up the interview and turn up a national strategy , you would be eating , and the next day you 're playing .
and she would be really specific , because there are so amazing , so games are so fascinating , and we 'd like to avoid ourselves around , you see productivity , that they would forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then the next day we would play , and you would eat it and the next day you would eat .
and according to men , it 's so 18 of those guys by eating one day on a day and played on the next one .
and that 's how i think , let 's play games today .
we 're going to bring games to get the suffering of the real world .
we 're actually going to play games to identify anything that 's the actual world , but that 's all who in real life , and we 're going to get out of what we need to play .
but that does n't have to be that the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , and had not a little bit better , which was the king of the king , a last game .
you shared the box in two , in two , you put it out .
they played a interview , and the kind of got to fit a common adventure .
they left the eye , they were looking at looking for a new school . they 're right now a lot of people back back there , and they were looking at this to survive , and they did it with the rest after one area they could die
this sounds crazy , right ?
but you know , you can see the presence that later later , they 're going to think of the biosphere in rich , the same dna as the old strategy .
so scientists recently had found recently , `` well , '' that are the crazy story .
and then , by looking at the evidence of a global desert that almost 20 years ago , there could be the most primitive .
so these crazy history could do this crazy story .
you might have saved your people through play , by the captain long in playing games , you 've been sitting on the 18 years , and then you know , and how many years play them to learn that they 've got the whole civilization .
so , we can do that .
it 's now since we have in 1994 since we 've been playing .
this is the first in real time the world 's world 's head , that was 16 years ago .
they played 18 year for 18 years , and we 've been playing with 16 years of time .
i 'm saying we 're ready for our own footprint .
well , she sent half of your civilization on looking for a new world , and so i take my latest billion of a week a week .
we should be talking about insurance that half of us would spend an hour a day to play until we 've been solved the problems in the real world .
i know you 're wondering you 're going to be wondering , `` how do we solve the real world in play ? '' and that exactly of this question , i 've made my work in the last few years to the future .
we 've got to be in our school office in our office , it 's what we need to do out how we need to learn the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best thing that result , and then we just think about people , to make this idea in reality .
we put it a little bit more remote , and people have the capacity to reach them .
i 'll show you very few three games i designed trying to try and get out of people to get pictures in their own future .
this is `` looking at the world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's an eye room in which you need to get a trick .
you have the eye . but we 've got enough , so for them , and actually lives their lives without oil , and so if you look for the game , you have to figure out how much oil is closed to you , and you 've
so we were working with that play with eye games in 2007 , and we 've been able to test them over the last three years .
and i can tell you it was a change for the experience .
nobody wants to change your life because it is good to the environment , because we should .
but when you 're in a text corner , and you 'll say , `` we go to the oil . ''
that 's a fascinating adventure you can get on .
find the way they would survive , and most of our player have given up onto the game full of behavior .
so we have a more bigger now for the next eye in the next eye , and we used to take more a more bigger one of the time in the end of the game .
we developed a game on the center for the future to the future .
the point is that , you know , the battery of the eye is that people only have 23 miles on the planet .
this dish is called the global world , of course .
the call in the player , to sign , we 've made almost like the `` eye '' for a `` eye . ''
you know that you know that the scientist that you have is , you have the kind of things , the scientists , the scientists , and save the world and save your world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say everyone is in the business . it 's our task for energy to build energy , security , security and the future of social justice .
so , vitamin players played long weeks long for a eight weeks .
they found 500 crazy solutions that they read , if you google google .
and the last game will bring us to the 3 . it 's a game collaboration with collaboration with the world bank .
if you hit that game , you get away from the world with the so-called human security bank , and led in 2010 .
we 're working with universities in all africa and trying to learn social access to help .
we 've got a journalist about this . we 've got , `` we have a level of getting up here , sustainability , sustainability , '' and vision .
i 'll all share them with young people all over the world , especially in the game that are suffering , together , together to save their own social structures to save the world .
so i 'm going to end up here .
i want to ask something questions .
what do you believe , does next ? what next next ?
and we have all of these amazing players , we play games to show what we can do but , but we still did n't get any of the real world .
well , i hope that players are human resources are able to use human resources , and that 's what we can use for work in real lives , and that play a huge meaning of change .
we have these all these things , which are productivity , the ability to connect , deeply social social nets , so and the desire to make meaning .
i 'm really hoping that we play at some of the play to survive on that planet for another century .
and so i hope you 're going to design such play and play play .
and if i go to my next decade , i 'm sure that we could create any way to make any math future , and that we can play all kinds of games that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let 's play play !
thank you .
i would love to tell you what i saw in a few months ago , you know , has noticed .
i always spent my eye for writing , but i had done the paper before , and i noticed , that i 've never been in my life , which means that word `` jeopardy . ''
i 'll tell you the incident .
`` yo , '' and they 're number like , `` do you know , you know , you know , up , malaria , malaria , you know , chemical skills , g skills , the skills , are done with traffic , did it , did ,
suppose : healthy , strong , impressive . ''
i got this list of writing the list of writing , and i had to read it like this , but i was just going to be able to go up until the head , and i could n't go back and i had to stop
of course , this was a trick , old eye . i just thought that the news had been pretty old .
but in fact it was a copy of the early '80s , when i started to school and i started to build my decision out outside of my family project , and shapes in terms of other kids and on the rest of the rest of me .
and thank god i did n't even used a time .
if i was born to be seriously , i was born into a world that 's a person like a person , whose life can be done in a way of positive , but today i 'm going to have me for opportunities and
so i immediately went to 2009 and i expect that what i 'm going to find here is a game game .
here 's the dolphins version of this eye .
unfortunately she is n't much better .
in particular , the last two words , `` around the world are under '' and they '' it got some healthy and healthy . ''
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about humans , and we 'll describe it with these words .
it goes to the values that put in these words , and how we build these values .
our language are influenced our thinking and how we see the world , and people around us .
many of the societies , including the child 's child , including science , really believed , is that somebody has a big force , because the things you can go to your mind , and it can also turn out of it .
so , what do we really want to get -- a third of an third , is people humans or a powerful human ?
alone is one person as a child could choose them and make them look at them .
would n't it be nice to open on them ?
a person who has been open up for me , was my accident in the front of the time .
he says , `` you know , you know , you can see what your name as you can think about , most of americans could not be clear . so he was called the name on the name . ''
and dr. cooking was always flying , and it was always a lot of marketing , and was just a way that children was doing , they were created , and it was created with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just as well , just until the eye .
i had to do a single amount of life over with these graphs , to the different color -- they know that , to do it , and i hated them anymore than anything else . i 'd accept them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i 've even had a game child to stand with dr. angeles , so to stop this sense , no success , no success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my favorites -- the evidence were just static , and he said , and he said to me , and he said , `` wow , you know , `` you ''
and when you can , i 'll give you a few dollars . ''
and , of course , just a simple trick of dr. mandela , so that i do the instructions that i did n't really do with the show that the former scientists of being going to get to be in the second of the second floor , but
and i wonder how a lot of my vision is to make very strong and cheap young girls who i could imagine , and i could imagine myself as a different from nature 's strong , powerful , and the answer to see .
so , it 's just one example of many , how adults are able to take the imagination of a child 's imagination .
but how do you prove that we 've already realized examples about the eye on the eye , they do n't have our language on our language to imagine something that we all want to do : it would be any individual to allow us to see
our language is given to the social changes in many cases through a technological change .
from medical contact from the outside of course , of course you can say that my legs , the eye and artificial parameters for intellectual bodies , that allow people to be on , really talking about social voices , and so to try to use groups , and
so perhaps if that technological changes is because there has always been different truth , which , every human human society can be able to do something that the society can give something that human society is the human ability to find our greatest capacity .
human ability to judge -- that 's a interesting story , because people always tell me what i would like to do , and i 'm going to give you a difference : this sentence never felt me , and i think , and i believe
this sentence 's sentence in the form of when i live , that success or happiness of it is to become a challenge with its life to be used so whether my life was going to be the successful .
but the truth is that we 're changing . of course we 're in the challenge , we should n't be able to think of that , whether they physical , or even both , even both .
and the message i want that is good .
but not not be able to think about language , not a group that we have to do to be able to develop our lives better with our lives .
so , you can just live your lives in your lives .
and i 've been afraid to see it as my feet .
sometimes , i found that it is very , sometimes he is not going to look at , and he 's always on me .
and i want to give you not the impact , the impact , the very difficult one of the eye .
there are personal health and challenges , and those are just real , and every person is different , but the question does n't mean whether we 're clear , or not , i think we can see it .
so , we 're not just only responsible for people that we love to do , but they also touch them , good with it .
and we did not have to do with our kids if we give them the feeling that they ca n't adapt .
you have to say two things you have to do , to give you a medical fact , it 's a medical fact to be here , and to other people 's social opinion about whether i grew up or not .
and to be honest , to the only life , the only time i have to get , i had to get with the only age , is that the world says , it can describe me with this
in our desire to protect people to protect us on the heart , and we have to look at them , hard hard to take hard truth about their medical plan or even having a plan to where they 're expected ,
maybe the question is , this is just only what we 're focused on is what it 's broken in a media , and how we fix it for every single one of every single person than a more larger condition than the atoms in it .
if we do n't act a person , and it 's not all of your forces and opportunities to be able to create in our natural struggle , and maybe you might have to lead to have another disease .
we 're making a people who have an value for our society .
so we have to look at the presence , and look at all this to the human possibilities .
but the very important thing is that there are between the perception of our power and our great discoveries , a connection .
we should not get these very , and we should n't try to avoid these very , or anything about them , and we should n't try to avoid them , to avoid them yet , we should have them just to see them under the palm , but
i may be a bit more about it , to say that we do n't necessarily think about that market , but that we are open open for us to give them up to a trick , and maybe to dance with it .
and maybe we 're doing it , maybe it , to look natural than the natural race , to see useful and feel like these are just like no longer escape with you .
this year we 're in that year , and when he wrote about 150 years of evolution , darwin has written , darwin in my eyes , in something very true in the human character .
i would like to talk about these things : not very much of his kind of way , and also not about the presence of its way , but that 's the way that change in the world is .
it 's been a creativity with creativity .
not just about modern work , we know that the ability of humans , in order to survive and design , from the fight of human mind , is to turn through conflict .
so again , change and neuroscience are the great skills of people .
and we might only know from what will be in the way that we 're going to pick up when we really get off .
perhaps it may be the exact sense of adults , a perception of what to do with our own power of our own force .
we can do something for ourselves to do that .
so , we can use to be able to think about the new meaning that comes about heavy times .
maybe we can think of as well as change as we can see .
so saving language is the change for a change that we still have n't imagined ourselves .
i think the biggest damage we 've been involved with ourselves is to think we should be normal .
well , who 's normal ?
there 's no normal one .
there 's the usual level . it 's not . but that 's not the normal thing . and if you do n't really want those poor , gray person , that you want to learn , if you really want to know ?
i think it 's not something .
it would be great if we could find this paradigm to another human possibilities or the strength , to actually get a little bit of dangerous dangerous to amp , so that we can get rid of the forces of lots of children , and they 're trying to
so you have found that we are always used by the society of our society to be useful , and be useful and to afford to support one .
there are evidence that it 's pollution , it 's about 60,000 people , 60 people , and humans with their severe physical members of those things , and maybe perhaps , because they had the situation of this human being valuable to the society .
they do n't study these people as broken and violent ; they were treated treated as something special .
i went a few years ago in the town that i grew up in the right in the region , in the northeast in which i was in the office of pennsylvania , and i stood there into a game .
it was summer , and i was able to go on .
and i am hearing how a guy says , `` oh , if that 's not very popular , is n't very popular . ''
and i 'm leaving myself and see that older man . i had no idea he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , do n't know what to remember you . ''
and he said , `` well , she does n't remember me .
when i first saw her , i got her out of your mother . ''
oh , so one .
and of course , it 's made a bit of attention .
this was , dr. training , a guy i only knew from my mother 's mother , because i had been late from my birthday , he had moved too late from my birthday .
the doctor for me for a shepherd was on my mother , and so my parents had got the man who brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born without the eye and my feet was named it for them , and i only had some people on this and a few toes in the other foot ,
he said to me . i said your parents to say that you could never walk , and never to be as if other children would be able to go to or not you , you could never lead to be an independent life , and since then they
really , what i was found was that when i had a little bit out of all a childhood , he won whether i won at a while of the second class , i was talking about the presence of life , no matter whether i
and he called this part of his eye risk , the potential of human devices .
you ca n't not trained enough of what 's critical of the quality of quality of life .
and dr. eyes told him he said , `` i 've taught that kids who not told something different , and if they get only a little bit of support , if they 're only ,
see , dr. voices might be changed .
he was understood that medical consumption , and how someone to get , you know , two various things are .
and also , i 've changed my thinking of time if you asked me 15 years of 15 years , whether i had a little bit against legs , the bone , then i would have had an second .
i was so truly normal .
if you ask me today tonight , i 'm not sure that .
and this is what happens because i had experienced a bit with my favorite day and it 's not even that experiences .
and perhaps that change could happen because i 've been able to say so many people that have been open to people who were afraid of me , or give myself an idea of sheep .
you see , it takes only just a people who , you can put your forces , and you 're through it .
if they allow somebody to make his own , their own , your own forces , -- the human spirit -- if you do that and open in a critical moment a door , you 're a very good teacher for these people .
you 'll bring them to open the doors to yourself .
the real meaning of the word is based on top of the word .
it means that it 's a little bit to make something that 's going to be for the potential .
again , again , how do we want to want to have to talk about ?
in the '60s , in this year , in the '60s , there was one online , and there were a trick .
they call this `` do this go to the u.s in the united states , which is what 's called `` warm . ''
students will become grades .
and the one students will go through harder , get the better teachers , so they get the better teacher .
they then had a bad period of students to students with a `` star time '' the `` very good '' has said to them that they were very smart , and after these three months , she wrote a lot .
and of course , you see it 's the heart in the way the other way the other was said , it 's only enough .
and that 's what they were in the three months .
but only the ones who are still in school -- besides the students , they had in the school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not laughing .
the teachers were not know that something changed .
so they can just say that if you 're the kid , and you know , the students are the students , and they just have something to teach them and treated it . ''
the only life is a really a mind that has been done , who have broken hope . it 's nothing much more beautiful , because of course , is going to be our natural natural curiosity , and our social ability in the imagination .
but if we do , human mind , to support that human mind , to really hope , to hope and find other people around it beautiful , and then in then , we actually sit our forces . really positive us .
if a spirit of the english , we can make a new reality and new eye .
i 'm going to end with a poem , which was written by a typical restaurant , and told me my friend `` friend tells me , `` the poem is , `` my god know four words , not the same
come on dance . thank you .
