and as steve training , apparently the los angeles times , one day through los streets to the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
and she came away from a man , a coffee , engineer , broccoli , homeless , who was playing on one restaurant , who had only two years to have two years .
a lot of you will know the story , because of paper , you 've got a book later , and again a book , which was
solly went to go back and went to the interview , and 30 years later , it was lived as memory in the streets of the center of los angeles .
i 'm very much to read all of you , and we 're looking to read the film so you do n't just get the wonderful glasses between these two men that you have , but also the idea that the music was to make it and
i met frank contact in 2008 two years ago , in the effect of the effect , `` i follow . ''
he just had heard a fan of the street first , and monkeys heard behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very eye , and he 's a lot of sound of the book , and la clinton and la clinton , and he was just like the sum that he never would never do it in the classic world , and this is all because
we came to talk about music . and a couple days later , i was born an email in which we 'd think that was interested in writing with me .
i have to mention more , that sugar has been an final treatment , because it was already used to it and have been treated with it and it had been treated with the eye and it 's being treated , a genius that has been taken his life
as a result , he 's really particularly active to these signals , which are sometimes evil , and he 's talking about six days in the street , and the people 's mind in the streets , and the
and in fact , in fact , in the same time that we started in mit when we were talking about our first day in the effect room , they began to start started started , he 's just simply lost white in his eyes and just lost .
he talked about invisible hall and smoke and about it , like someone wanted to slow him in sleep .
i had scared , but i was afraid that he could destroy him in his own states , and that i could destroy his relationship to
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first sentence of street .
and as i was playing and i was born , that in the way , that you have a full bit on the same way .
it was as if he was under a invisible position , a chemical reaction that was my game .
so you 're looking at anger in understanding , in terms of curiosity and diabetes .
and like a miracle took his apartment and started to play some of a look and asked me , to play them to be : okay , you know .
and we started talking about music , we started to go on to you know , you know , go from all the other microscope up to yourself up to yourself .
and i realized that he was n't just knowledge about music for music , but to make it a strong personal relationship .
he talked about her a passion and a understanding that i would just know of my colleague from my colleagues in the border of los angeles .
by being asked music , he talked about music and talked about this game , and the fellow man , which was led through the streets of going on los angeles , a coffee game , you know ,
music is art . music changes us .
for us , it 's been music , and music became that 's `` music , '' music .
and the music allows to him , the thoughts , and forced with help his imagination and creativity .
and then it 's got to a lot of them .
and i understood that this is exactly the most art of the art .
and that 's what we 're doing music , so that we can do something that is going to be a very deep place in the inside , our feelings through our artistic lens through how to shape our creativity .
and reality is the word word , all of us , moving us , inspired , and we put it together .
what 's a lot of death away , so it brought him back to a community of a community of friends .
the game 's music brought it back into a family of a family in mind , who understood him that they realized in and looked at it .
and i 'll go back to a long music music , and if you 're able to look at the effect of the effect , i say , if i go to go up , or in your own row , because he reminds me why i am a
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
sebastian betti means .
robert t : i want to play something that i 'll do with the holy vagina .
so i hope you 'll talk about me experiment .
so i knew many fish in my life .
i have only two loved loved ,
this first , which was more like such a passionate movie .
it was a beautiful fish ,
so , what a fish .
and better better , it was in the presence of the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel with you to sell it .
i had a beauty had a relationship over several months .
and one day of the head of company called her head and asked whether i could have a event , could be the sustainability of the farm .
`` obviously , i said , `` of course . ''
here 's a company who was trying to figure out what this product problem was for our wedding , how do we fall fish on our lives ?
in the past 50 50 years , we 've done more , we have killed the oceans as we are doing forests ,
it 's hard to get the destruction to cooperate .
90 percent of the big fish who we love , the apple , the ones the eye , the eye , the ones , the ones , the right , they were closed .
there 's almost nothing left left .
so , you know , or bad is there , the other one , part of us to be a part of our future .
many people go to . they 're fighting the environment , most of them anyway , and you are in gas , they take clean down . a big ring .
he has one of the eye from one 15 .
that is , 15 pounds of fish are needed to get so you .
not very sustainable .
also not very good either .
so here was finally a company who tried to make it properly .
i was wearing them .
the day before day , i called the head of the birth to the 1990s for a company .
let 's call it to it 's a guy .
`` upwake , '' i said , `` only to have the facts right to the facts , there 's so far from the sea that you 're not sure of the environment . ''
`` right , '' he said , `` it 's so far , and we 're out of that , that the waste will be distributed off of our fish , not focused . ''
and then he 's going , `` we are basically a family world .
so you can say that you can go from one into the game , and he said he said .
`` the best in industry . ''
let 's go with you . great .
let 's do one what caused your ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' said .
i said `` great '' ; you put out .
and at this evening i got in bed , and i thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day and just before i had a little day , i call a short day .
i said , `` k , what 's sustainable machines ? ''
he said , he does n't do it . he 'll get care .
now , i started playing with some people in the company , no one could give me a three-dimensional answer ,
and i also call it a result .
`` upwake '' i said , `` what 's a sustainable proteins ? ''
now , he said , some of them mentioned , and some of you mentioned , and he told me , and then he said to me .
i said , `` are you ? ''
he said , `` yes , the arts , skin , flowers , the skills and it 's a food . ''
i said to say , `` how much percent do you get chicken ? ''
perhaps two percent .
`` well , this is roughly 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` i said , what is sustainable about fish in fish ? ''
there was a long and a long job of the line and he said , `` there is just too much chicken on the world . ''
i am looking at this fish .
no , do n't , because i 'm a trick and make you go .
that 's me , actually .
no , i was actually able to go through that fish from this fish , because , i quit a fish , the fish , to chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of a favorite .
it 's romantic 's way of doing the way you 're learning with your fish , you 're going to see the fish anymore .
i first have eaten him in a restaurant .
one is a big journalist ever talked about this fish for a long time .
it 's kind of a lot .
he came up on the table with a light of the light , almost it 's a lot of weird white white white .
the chef had a head to him .
hold around .
